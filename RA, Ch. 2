Igros Castle's Courtyard

(Algus, Alma, Delita, Ramza, and Teta are together in Igros Castle's courtyard following Teta's rescue.)

Teta: It all happened so fast.

Alma: You're safe now. You're back with us.

(Alma hugs Teta)

Teta: I missed you. You and brother.

Delita: I don't know what I'd do without you Teta...

Teta: Brother!

(Delita hugs Teta)

Teta: I missed you... I was so scared. You should have seen it!

Delita: You're safe now. They can't hurt you. And after tomorrow they'll be gone. I promise.

Teta: Gone...? But, brother...

Algus: We got a good start on exterminating the lot of them.

Teta: What... what do you mean?

Algus: Zeakden was an infestation. We did our duty and exterminated the vermin.

(Teta gasps, placing her hand over her mouth)

Teta: No... no... that's just... how can you see them that way?

Algus: We can't all be as naive as you, girl.

(Teta looks away)

Teta: We can't just kill people like that.

Algus: Are you blind? The moment they kidnapped you, they ceased to be human! We did our duty, and for it, I was promoted.

Ramza: Algus... you don't have to overdo it. 

Ramza: Are you worried about that girl who sent you home? (Teta nods.) I'm sure she's fine, Teta. If she has any sense, she wouldn't stay with a sinking ship like the Death Corps.

Algus :Who are you all talking about?

Delita: This doesn't concern you, Algus. This is our little secret.

Algus: Yes it does. I'm in charge now! 

Alma: Teta, lets go. Ramza, we'll talk after life settles down a bit.

(Alma and Teta Exit Scene)

(Algus looks to Ramza)

Algus: Tomorrow we set out for Fovoham. It will be our task to restore the rightful duke to his estate.

Algus: There are no secrets between us, Ramza. Your hound better know that too, or I'll discipline him next time.

(End Scene)

[Party Goes To Fovoham Plains]

Fovoham Fields

(Algus, Delita, and Ramza arrive in a rural area on the approach to the town. Farmers are workimg the fields within view.)

Algus: All right, our orders are to persuade the magistrate to join us. 

Delita: We should be careful. If they wanted to start a fight here, we'd have no way out. 

Ramza: I don't think they're expecting us. It's really calm around here.

Delita: Lets hope it stays that way.

[Algus approaches the peasants]

Algus: Good day, peasants. On behalf of his Duke Lans, Lord of Fovoham, we would like to speak with your master.

[The peasants turn to look at him.]

Peasant #1: Follow me, "sir", I'll take you there.

[Peasant walks partway to the edge of the map, stopping directly beside peasant #2, and turns to look at said peasant.]

Peasant #1: Bring the others.

[Peasant #1 continues onwards. Algus, Delita, and Ramza follow.]


Fovoham Township

(Peasant is leading Algus, Delita, and Ramza down a street. They stop in the middle of the area.)

Ramza: Something is wrong.

(Algus and Delita turn to look at Ramza)

Ramza: It feels like we've been down this street already. Did we just go in a circle?

Peasant #1: Of course not. We're just taking a shortcut.

(Algus turns and grips the peasant by the collar.)

Algus: Damn it! I'm warning you, if you try to trick us, we will kill you and your dirt town.

Peasant #1: You're guests in our town. If we wanted to, we could kill you instantly.

Algus: That's big talk from a mouse.

Peasant #1: I wasn't bluffing, fool..

(Constable enters from the rear, as well as Peasant Milita from both front and rear. thereby surrounding the party.)

Peasant #2: What are you Hokuten even doing here? This ain't your town.

(Algus looks behind him and then back to Peasant #1)

Algus:You dare trick me!?

(Battle Begins)

Constable: Cut them down! We can't let these scouts report back to the main force!

Peasant #3: This is it isn't it? The Hokuten have finally come for us. We're all going to die aren't we?!

Constable: No, my friend... even if they've come for us, this isn't the end! We have plenty of fight left in us!

Delita: We aren't your enemy. We merely wish to see the ruler of this town.

Peasant #3: This town belongs to all of its people. If you want to speak to our rulers, you might as well speak with us.

Algus: What dreck! Just kill them!

(Turn Two Begins)

Ramza: This town belongs to the Magistrate.

Peasant #1: We do the work of the town. Do we not also have a say?

Delita: But how? You can't all decide.
Peasant #2: We each have a turn at the council. We're not like you nobles who stay in power until you rot in your own filth.

Delita: I was born no different than you! I'm not like that...

Algus: You may be a dog Delita, but you're our dog. Now, shut your mouth and kill these vermin!

(If Algus is KO'd)

Algus: No... this can't happen...

(On Victory)

Algus: How could they... trick me? Damn it! They're just stupid peasants!

(Battle Ends)


(Algus, Delita, and Ramza are walking down the street into a plaza)

Algus: This seems to be the center of town. Their local lord must live near here.

Ramza: Why would a noble live in town among the peasants?

Algus: Just another indignity the false Duke has forced on them.

Delita: I heard it was a voluntary arrangement.

Algus: Hold your tongue Delita! What do you know of nobility?

(The local lord and an entourage show up)

Magistrate: What are you doing to my town?

Algus: Doing to it? We're restoring order. We've come to help you cast off the yoke of the false Duke.

Magistrate: Our town was in order, until you Hokuten started bloodying your swords. As the sworn guardian of this town, I will show you no mercy.

(Battle Starts)

Algus: Why... why are you fighting us!? Aren't you glad we're liberating you from these indignities?!

Magistrate: I am not a prisoner. The only indignity is having a squire tell me to whom I owe fealty. You do not know your place, boy!

Algus: W... what... do you mean?!

Magistrate: I serve a rightful lord, with the sanction of the Crown. Duke Lans is the true usurper, and Prince Larg is his patron!


(Second Turn Begins)

Ramza: Prince Larg is a higher authority; if you have any honor, you would surrender!

Magistrate: This town is my estate. Its people are in my care. What kind of man would I be to surrender them to the wolves?

Algus: The Prince is a lion, not a wolf. He has a nobility no peasant can compare.

Magistrate: My men have already died on the orders of your lionheart. A prince who lives apart from his subjects has no authority.

(Third Turn Begins)

Algus: This is absurd! It is Prince Larg's birthright to rule, can't you see that?

Magistrate: My men have demonstrated more nobility than Prince Larg. Any coward can damn his subjects from a faraway palace, a slave to his own ignorance; only the truly noble are free to govern themselves!

Algus: You dare to spit on the name of your Prince!?

Magistrate: You, cadet, did not fight in the last war. I can excuse your ignorance, but I owe these men my life.

Delita: Is that why you've granted these privileges to your subjects?

Magistrate: Indeed. Sixe freed them to fight and to produce. Never have I seen lands so fertile and never have I seen braver men fight alongside me.They have earned their freedom and I won't let anyone take that away!

Algus: You'd rather swear fealty to a pirate? B... but... that's inexcusable!

Magistrate: You are the one without excuses. Lay down your weapons and I may show you mercy!

Algus: Never!

(When the Magistrate is KO'd)

Algus: Fool! He should have listened to me! 

(Battle Ends)


Church In Fovoham

(Algus enters the local church, and approaches the priest)

Algus: I must speak with you!

(The priest is looking away.)

Priest: What is the matter?

(The priest turns around.)

Priest: Oh... you're one of the Hokuten aren't you?.

Algus: Yes, I am of the Hokuten. 

Priest: Have you come to confess your sins?

Algus: No Father, not my sins. The sins of this wretched town! 

Priest: And what, pray tell, do you speak of?

Algus: We've come to restore the rightful authority of Duke Lans, but these treasonous peasants and the "magistrate" have resisted! I have come seeking your blessing in burning out the rot.

(Priest steps backwards in shock)

Algus: In God's name we will purge the town by fire.

Priest: I will give you no blessing for doing the devil's work!

Algus: The devil's work? But Father! These people...

Priest: ...are being saved through Ajora's grace. More people now are receiving the gospel and this town is flourishing. Is this not a blessing from God?

Algus: How can Heaven ordain your rebellion against rightful authority? If there be any fruit, it's of the devil!

Priest: Confess your sins onto me, child. Repent of your blasphemous wrath, or face the fires of Hell! 

Algus: Shut up!

(Algus): Stabs the priest.
 
Priest: By the blood of Ajora, exalted be...the martyrs...

(End Scene)



House in Fovoham

(A man, a woman, a boy, a girl, and a monk are sitting at a dinner table. The man is holding a book.)

Monk: Go on...

Man: G.. go... God... he.

Monk: Yes, that's the first word.

(Ramza And Delita enter.)

Ramza: Alright, everyone is to clear out.

Man: What? Who are you?

Delita: We're with the Hokuten.

Ramza: We've been ordered to burn this place.

Woman: No! You can't do that! We won't let you!

Man: Sarah... quiet yourself. I will deal with this.

Man: Brother Stephen, please get our children to safety.

(Ramza and Delita allow the monk and children to pass them and go out the door. The man and woman remain. The girl lingers at the door.)

Girl: Mama?

(The monk re-enters and makes the girl follow him out.)

Ramza: Please clear out! We don't want anyone hurt!

Man: You're here to burn down our home? Do the Hokuten have no respect for the laws of God?

Ramza: I... Didn't you hear me? You need to go! 

(The man and woman grab weapons â€“ a crossbow and knife respectively. )

(Battle Begins)

Man: Why can't you leave us be?! Don't make me shoot you!

Ramza: You don't have to do this! Just put down your weapons and leave!

(One of the two dies)

(If the Woman is KO'd)
	Man: Sarah... no!!! I will gut you... you monster!

(If the Man KO'd)
	Woman: No.. no... Micah!!  

(Battle Ends)

Ramza: What's becoming of us Delita?

(Delita looks down and stares at the floor)

Delita: ....

Ramza: God help us.

(Algus enters the house)

Algus: What is taking you so long? The rest of the squad is waiting on you.

Ramza: Algus... this isn't right.

Algus: Would you just follow orders for once Ramza!

Delita: Ramza is right.

Algus: Are you questioning my orders too, dog!?

(Algus punches Delita. Delita falls backwards to the floor but catches himself.)

Ramza: Delita!

(Delita rises back to his feet. Algus hands a lit torch to Ramza)

Algus: Take it.

Ramza: ...

Algus: I said take it!

(Ramza takes the torch)

(Algus steps towards Delita)

Algus: Now light up this god-damned house! If I have to repeat my order, I'll burn you with the house!

(Ramza tosses the torch into the corner, starting a fire.)

(End Scene)


(Algus, Delita, and Ramza are outside of town, on their way south. They stop when a knight on a chocobo comes riding into frame to the left of the viewer. The knight dismounts and collapses to his.)

Ramza: A Hokuten knight!

Knight: Ugh...

(Delita steps up to him)

Ramza: These wounds look bad, get a chemist over here!

Knight: Thank god I've found... someone who isn't out to kill me. 

Ramza: What happened to you? How did you sustain these wounds?

Algus: More importantly, why are you riding alone? Who is your commander?

Knight: Our commander was Sir Reynald...

Algus: Was?

Knight: Our entire cohort was routed... Sir Reynald fell in the fighting. I fled west looking for aid... but...  Hokuten forces... in retreat...  rebels everywhere...

Ramza: Maybe we can head south? The rebels must have the bulk of their forces tied up here, defending Fovoham. Maybe we can meet up with the Hokuten auxillary forces  in Lenalia?

Knight: No chance... you're in an envelopment...

(The man collapses and the chemist arrives. Both he, and Ramza kneels down next to the fallen knight.)

Ramza: Sir? Sir...? Say something!

Chemist: This man's wounds are too severe... he's been bleeding out far too long. There is nothing I can do for this man...

Algus: Damn those animals! 

Delita: If they haven't closed us in yet, we may still have a chance to escape. We need to retreat to the west now!

Algus: Shut up! I'm the one in charge here!

Algus: If we were to retreat now, it'd disgrace the knights! We should push eastward to attack their center. We'll break through there.

(End Scene)

(Algus, Delita, and Ramza walk through a field filled with sleeping Death Corps soldiers.)

Ramza: What happened here? How is it that everyone is asleep?

Delita: Magic? Some kind of poison carried on the wind?

Algus: Does it matter? We have them at our mercy, we should slay them now!

Delita: They're totally helpless! That would be murder!


Ramza: Algus please... can't we just keep moving? They could wake up at any moment, and we are all nearing exhaustion as it is. We can take this oppurtunity to pass right through. 

Algus: Fine... we'll keep moving for now. Until we find their commander.

(Algus, Delita, and Ramza continue on. They enter the next area, the Windmill.)

(A dying scream is heard)

Sixe: You cannot defeat me.

(The Camera pans over and Sixe comes into view along with a number of dead bodies,  surrounded by Balmafula, Rivaldi, and several ninjas. One Ninja lays dead at Sixe's feet.)

Balmafula: Your men have already been cut down. And those who have not been slain lie sleeping under my spell. You are but a single man.

Algus: What! Is that...

Delita: I knew it!

Sixe: The sea is more treacherous than your magic, and I will survive both!

(Sixe mounts his chocobo and attempts to flee. Rivaldi casts CT5-Flare on Sixe, knocking him off his chocobo. Sixe screams and dies instantly. Balmafula turns to look at the party.)

Rivaldi (chuckles): And so your luck finally ran out.

Balmafula: Sir, I am not so certain ours is any better. (She points at the Hokuten.)

Rivaldi: Cease your spell Balmafula. Let the Death Corps deal with them.

Ramza: Wait!

(Balmafula dispels the effect and the assassins teleport away. The Death Corps soldiers begin waking up.)

Death Corps Soldier #1: What... what happened?

Death Corps Soldier #2: Who are... my God... Sixe!

(The Death Corps soldiers begin to gather around Sixe's body.)

Death Corps Soldier #1: He's... dead?

Death Corps Soldier #2: No... he can't be...

Algus: The fools are damn near oblivious to us being here. Now is the time to strike; while they're still distracted, kill them!

Ramza: But...

Delita: We don't have to kill them!

Algus: Stop acting like children!

(The Death Corps soldiers turn to look at Algus, Delita, and Ramza)

Death Corps Soldier #1: Without Sixe... this is the end.

Death Corps Soldier #2: You... you did this didn't you?

Delita: Tell them what really happened, Ramza!

Algus: Just attack them!

Dialogue Choice:

	1. We have to fight!
	2. Wait... we can explain!


Choice #1

Ramza: No, Delita, we have to fight! We're still surrounded.

Delita: Damn it...

(Battle Starts)

(Round 1)

Death Corps Soldier #1: I may not have a future now... but there's no way in hell I'm gonna let Sixe's killers escape me alive!

Death Corps Soldier #2: Damn you lot to hell!

Algus: Ha! Upset are you?

(Battle Ends)


Choice #2

Ramza: Wait... we can explain! It wasn't us!

Delita: We didn't kill him, but we saw who did!

Algus: You imbeciles!

Death Corps Soldier #1: If not you, then who?


Ramza: I'm not sure who they were. Some manner of assassins.

Death Corps Soldier #1: Why should I believe you Hokuten bastards?

Delita: Because we didn't put you to sleep. Whoever did it wanted us to kill each other so they'd have no witnesses. Someone else is at work here.

Algus: Are you done yammering? Draw your sword, dog, so that we may cut you down!

Death Corps Soldier #2: Come to think of it, that kid's right. Isn't it odd how we all fell asleep after lunch at the same time?

Death Corps Soldier #1: Damn, what's the use? There is no point in fighting anymore. It's over.

Algus: What? You're surrendering? You finally accept your place?

Death Corps Soldier #2: I'm not surrendering, I'm going home.
