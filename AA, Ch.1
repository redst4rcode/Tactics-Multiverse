Accept Sixe / Corsa causes Delita and Ramza to go to Zeakden where they act as unwitting pawns of Sixe's plans. They kill Algus at the cost of Delita's life and by routing Algus' encirclement squad, causes Sixe's risky gambit at Zeakden to succeed (see path d). This path will involve the Zodiac stones because I intend to use this as the Dark Ramza storyline (where he becomes the host for Virgo).

(Myrm) love the concept, but I'm leery about putting him as Virgo. Virgo, far as I can tell, wanted Alma for her pure heart, and the stone chooses the body. It's not going to just settle for Alma because Ramza's too much of a loose cannon. Possibly have him as a different stone user? we only saw a few, and it shouldn't be too hard (conceptually) to sprite up a new Lucavi. I know there's one that's half coded (something about a time mage sharing the name), perhaps that zodiac instead?
Aries 	BELIAS 	 (Weigraf > Corsa)
Taurus 	DUMA 	 
Gemini 	ZALHERA 	 (Elmdor)
Cancer 	ZEBBEB 	 
Leo 	HASHMURIM 	 (Vormav)
Virgo 	ULTIMA 	 (Alma)
Libra 	SEL 	 
Scorpio 	CUCHRAIN 	 (Draclau)
Sagittarius 	ROPHOCHEHE 	 
Capricorn 	ADRAMELECH 	 (Dycedarg)
Aquarius 	CHERAUB 	 
Pisces 	LEVIATHAN

We could, even pad the storyline out with a couple extras. Personally, I'm leaning towards Leviathan for Ramza, since he's the demon of Wrath. Rophochehe would also be a good option, however, as he's halfway coded in (in name, at least)

Mission 4: Slums of Dorter Trade City

Cloaked Man: You're kidding, right?
Death Corps 1: We've had enough of you, and a change of management is in order.
Cloaked Man: So you'd rather stain your hands in blood rather than dirt? What kind of men are you?
Death Corps 2: We want to go forward, not backwards! My father toiled his whole life to buy our family's freedom. What makes you think I'd willingly return to the land as your serf, to work at your bidding?
Cloaked Man: Can't you see I am fighting in the same cause as your father? If we succeed, no one will ever again need to buy the freedom that is his birthright! Progress is a world where nobles and merchants have nothing beneath them and the peasant has no one above him. It is not a world where everyone fights to be a noble; oppression will simply grow back under another name. 
Death Corps 3: You're just chasing phantoms! There's always gonna be stupid people; if we don't take advantage, someone else will! (Draws their weapons)
Cloaked Man: You're right; as long as cruel and heartless fools like you lot exist, there can be no peace! (Cloaked Man draws his sword as Ramza, Delita, and Algus enter.) In the name of all, I will bury you under my feet!
(Enter Ramza, Delita, and Algus)
Ramza: What's going on here? Why is that man being attacked?
Algus: Must be the spy, leave him to his fate.
Delita: If that's the case, perhaps we should save him, Ramza? Your brother would be pleased to have what information he has.
Ramza: Good point, Delita. Let's go, save this man from the Death Corps!
Cloaked Man's Turn:
Cloaked Man: Traitors on one side, the Hokuten on the other. The Bear and the Lion are at each other's necks!
Ramza: Don't worry, we'll help you!
Cloaked Man: is he talking to me, or them? (OOC: I don't like this line, but I'm not sure how to fix it. (Myrm) line's flavour rather than content - theoretically unsure as to who Ramza's attacking. I can change/remove it, no problem.)

Post Battle:
Ramza: Are you unharmed?
Cloaked Man: Essentially.
Algus: Better than you deserve. So are you going to hand over the information, or no?
Cloaked Man: I don't have time for these games.
Algus: Why you little...(Delita holds Algus back; Algus's line here and Delita's restraint come as an interruption, and shouldn't stop the flow of Sixe's text)
Cloaked Man: The biggest rat is still hiding in the Sandy Cellar. He goes by the name of Gustav and he alone kidnapped Elmdor. [Rides away] (OOC: Builds the suspense, leads into Sixe's plot, and shows that Sixe is the one commanding the tempo of the negotiations.)
Ramza: Wait! How do you know that? Wait! (Algus shakes Delita off)
Algus: I don't get it. Who's this Gustav?
Delita: Gustav Magueriff, a captain of the Death Corps.
Algus: Fine, let's say that this animal has the information Lord Zalbag wants. Where do we find him?
Ramza: 'Sand Rat Cellar'.
Algus: Sand ra-a-a-ts?
Delita: Algus may not know what they are since he's not from here. "Sand Rats" only inhabit the Zeklaus Desert north of Dorter.
Algus: Wha?
Ramza: Was there a village between Dorter and Zeklaus Desert?
Delita: Not anymore. But there is a place where desert people used to gather...
Ramza: ......Gustav and the Marquis may be there.
Delita: Yes, probably.
Algus: What are you all talking about?
Ramza: The desert people are known as "Sand Rats". The "Cellar" is their nest.
Algus: ...Of course...seems only appopriate for vermin like them... (OOC: I'm not sure how else to show Algus is embarrassed for being stupid. The vanilla dialogue needs a tweak because it always seemed fairly obscure to me when I read it through.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 5: Same

After Mission 5 (Broken Down Stone Shed):
Cloaked Man (no longer wearing his hat from before): Why have you betrayed us, Gustav?
Gustav: Surprised that I took a page out of your playbook, Sixe? You think you're the only one with a brain?
Sixe: What?
Gustav: I know about the Romandian silver. How else would a shit like you rise so fast? It's time for me to give you a taste of your own medicine!
Sixe: Is this your best excuse? I'm sorry, Gustav, not even an idiot like Prince Larg would accept that.
Sixe lowers his blade. Gustav sees the opening, and takes it. (Dies as in vanilla.)
Sixe: You had so much potential, but you never once learned from your mistakes. Goodbye, Gustav.
Enter Ramza and crew.
Algus: Marquis! (Gasps) You...you're Sixe!
Sixe: (OOC: Insert Witty comment here)
Elmdor: ugghhh....
Algus: If you touch one hair on his head, I'll kill you!
Sixe (sheathes his blade): Relax. The Marqius is unhurt. Take him back to Limberry.
Algus: What?! Don't trifle with me.
Sixe: I am not your enemy. I did not order this attack. This pathetic coward (points to Gustav) was merely following the orders of Prince Larg and Lord Dycedarg. Treasonous scum like him don't deserve to live.
Ramza: What? You mean to say...my brother ordered this...?
Sixe: So you're the youngest Belouve? (Sixe reaches into his shirt and produces two folded documents.) Your pride must be hurt, but I have proof.
Algus: You're nothing but trash! You think you can beat us? You probably just made the whole...
Delita: Enough, Algus! He's serious.
Ramza: Delita, you mean...you actually believe him? Surely, Lord Brother wouldn't...
Delita: Even if it is fake, I'd rather the letters in our hands. Think of the consequences if Prince Goltana were to get ahold of them!
Algus: Don...don't be paranoid, Delita. Ramza and I both know the Prince would never believe such a ridiculous conspiracy theory. (OOC: Algus is trying to hide his stupidity and desire. He just realized Delita's fear that Sixe would give the information to Goltana via Elmdor is actually a good idea that would benefit him. AS a result, he's trying to obstruct Delita without showing his hand. Feel free to improve on this.)
Ramza: Even if you're right, Algus, we cannot take any chances.
Algus: Grr...(his eyes meet Sixe's as he hands over the letters) Hold it, we're not done with you! (Sixe leaves the room; Algus tries to chase but is blocked by Delita) Damn you, Delita, why do you stop me?
Delita: Don't risk it. The Death Corps will destroy itself.

Intermezzo at Igros: If Ramza accepts Sixe's offer, Ramza and Delita then turn over the evidence to Dyce for confirmation, who promptly throws it in the fire.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 6: At Thieves' Fort, you fight Corsa [my Miluda replacement and Sixe's wife]. In the pre-battle scene, she enters the fort on a yellow chocobo and takes the role of optimistic leader [while the thieves around her are the ones with doubts].
Interaction:
Priestess: Why are you nobles even fighting us? We aren't your enemy.
Algus: Humph...ridiculous. You dogs need to know in your place!
Corsa: Maybe you should know yours. We starve ourselves to feed the likes of you. We exhaust our youth to forge your weapons and fight your wars. Have you no gratitude, or at least some shame? You are ruining people no different than yourselves!
Algus: Human? These dogs were never human! They were born to serve and die for us! It's the Will of Heaven! Why don't you see this, and stop rolling in their own filth with them?
Priestess: Heaven? God would never say such things! In his eyes, we are all equal.
Algus: Animals have no God!
Priestess: !!!!
Corsa: Enough, [insert generic name here]. We aren't all pigs like him.
Algus: !!!!
Delita: Algus, calm down. Don't prove her right.

Corsa: So many innocent lives...why did we have to fight today?
Ramza: I...I...
Algus: Don't lose your resolve, Ramza! Kill her now! She's your enemy and an enemy of your family! She wants to live like a mongrel, treat her like one. How can she even be a leader? Losers cannot remain alive! Besides, if we don't kill her, she'll kill us! We cannot coexist! Kill her, Ramza, with your own hands!!!
Delita: Ramza, I don't see why she is our enemy.
Algus: What did you say?! Are you mad, Delita?
Delita: She's not an animal...She's human just like us...
Algus: Are you betraying us?! You too?! Damnit, I'll kill her myself! (lunges forward)
Corsa smiles and whistles. A yellow chocobo charges straight at Algus, who sidesteps the bird. In one motion, Corsa mounts the bird and kicks Algus. She leaves the scene leaving Algus dumbstruck.

Intermezzo at Mandalia: Same

Background: Windmill Shed (inside)
Sixe: Golagros, Corsa, explain yourselves.
Golagros: Your stupid girlfriend lost the Weather Unit! I had to take a hostage to escape!
Corsa: So the ends justify the means?
Golagros: Fucking bitch! You only got away because my raid created a diversion. I covered your ass!
Corsa: Stop lying. When I arrived in Mandalia the first time that afternoon to complete my mission, the Hokuten chased me the entire way. Where were you then?
Golagros: Where I was assigned, Mandalia North. The Hokuten had a fuckton of volunteers and I was busy.
Corsa: And why did the Hokuten have so much support?
Golagros: Do I really have to answer this again? The moment the Knights come, all the fuckups and assholes will come out like bees to honey.
Corsa: Golagros, do you ever listen? They only exist because you are no better than the Hokuten. You can't just force people to obey us.
Golagros: Damnit Corsa, stop dodging the blame! Why the hell did you lose the Weather Unit?
Corsa: The enemies were no older than me. Except for one of them...something about them...I just couldn't kill them.
Golagros: So you risked your own life and had our men die?!
Corsa: Well, I didn't see a way to get away without killing them all.
Golagros: Are you fucking serious? (turns to Sixe) Sixe...I know she's your girl and all, but how the hell does she have the same rank as me? She has no killer instinct! She's just a little girl who can't even kill someone without crying.
Sixe: Enough! Both of you have harmed our efforts. Golagros, your raid gave the Hokuten the moral advantage; you just proved all of their worst lies true.
Golagros: Com'on, Sixe, don't you see?! She's not just any hostage; she's a Belouve! We can force 'em to do what we want noW!
Sixe: The Belouves will then attract the sympathy of everyone who has ever lost a child. Do you think we can fight them all?
Golagros: They already had that Elmdor bit... 
Sixe: We made fools of Gustav's followers because we stood by our principles, Golagros. That's why the peasants remained loyal. But now, with your actions, even they must have doubts. Starting tomorrow, I'm redeploying you. Anabelle will tell you more. (Golagros leaves; Corsa turns to leave.) Corsa, I'm not done. 
Corsa (turns around): Yes?
Sixe: You cannot keep doing this. We only have so many men. I'm assigning you to the militia until I can trust you in command.
Corsa: Sixe, will the Hokuten even attack us here? Lenalia hasn't faced a real threat in months.
Sixe: Don't let your hopes blind you, Corsa. With our other units already defeated, they must us attack here.
Corsa: ...what of the girl? We can't keep her here.
Sixe: We won't stay long in this base. When we leave, I'll return her.
Corsa: What?! (Corsa runs to leave.)
Sixe: Corsa, wait...(Sixe runs to leave)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 7:

Interaction:
Corsa: Just my luck. You are Delita, correct?
Delita: Where is Teta? Where are you hiding her?!
Corsa: I will lead you to your sister if we both lay down our arms. (She places her sword onto the ground.)
Death Corps Knight: Commander, are you insane?
Corsa: Trust me, [insert random name]. We won't need to fight.
Ramza:
Option A = I don't believe you.
Option B = I made a promise to Delita.

Corsa: Let's hurry.
Delita: Teta... (Skip the battle.)

Fovoham Plains
Sixe: I take you were successful, Corsa?
Corsa: Yes, and you?
Sixe (shakes his head): The Hokuten are already attacking Zeakden.
Ramza: How is this possible? Didn't Dycedarg promise us...
Sixe: Did you want to say something, Belouve?
Delita: We're mean no harm; we just want Teta back!
Sixe: You wear the uniform of my enemy. Why should I believe you, Belouve?
Ramza: Delita's not the Belouve; I am! On my family's honor, I swear that we came here on our own free will only to see Teta's return!
Sixe: Your familiy has no honor!
RAmza: S..Sixe, how dare you mock my family?!
Sixe: If you are truly so loyal to your family, then why are you disarmed before me instead of fighting for your family at Zeakden?
Ramza: Our honor comes from doing right! My brothers put victory above all else, even the safety of our family. They even lied to me so I would not doubt them.
Sixe: I take it, then, that my accusations aren't without merit?
Ramza: I...I don't know, but if they choose to act without honor, I want nothing to do with it!
Sixe: For a Belouve to reject his own family before his enemy, I guess this too is part of your legendary courage? (Sixe turns to Corsa.) No need to send Slim; I'll free her myself. Just bring these boys with you.
Corsa: Sixe...are you sure?
Sixe: You've risked enough today; I must also share the burden. Besides, I have a special assignment for you.
Corsa: Sixe...(smiles)

Windmill Shed (Outside)
Delita: Ramza, something's not right.
Delita: Sixe's up to no good, I just know it. There's no way he'd change his attitude towards us that fast.
Ramza: I want to believe him, I think he did change
Delita: Still though, we should be on our guard; this IS their hideout, after all.
Door opens with Teta and Corsa. Teta runs to Delita who hugs her tightly.
Delita: Teta! Are you all right? I missed you!
Teta: Oh Delita! I was so scared!
Delita: They didn't hurt you, did they, Sister?
Teta: No, not really...
Delita: I....I'm just glad you're back (holds her tighter.)
Teta: Delita...
Delita: Yes?
Teta: I want to stay with you. I feel safe with you
Delita (lets go of Teta): I...I'm sorry, Teta.
Teta (surprised): Delita?
Ramza: I think...Delita means that he's worried for your safety. We're about to head off into battle.
Teta: Delita, where are you going with Ramza?
Delita (looks hesitantly at Corsa and then at Ramza): Can we trust her, Ramza?
Ramza: You shouldn't worry about her, Delita. I'm sure she already knows from Sixe.
Delita: ...Teta, we're going off to Fort Zeakden to defeat the Death Corps garrison there.
Delita: You could be killed if you come with us, Teta. I just found you; I don't want to lose you again
Teta: You think I feel any differently, brother? I don't want to lose you either!
Corsa: Then let me go. I'll protect Teta.
Delita: I'm sorry, Corsa, but we only came for Teta. You are now our enemy. I can't let you come with us.
Teta: Delita, that's enough! I trust Corsa with my life! This whole rescue was her idea, and she was the only one who treated me with any kindness back there.
Delita: Do you think she'd willingly commit treason against her own allies?
Corsa: If I am truly your enemy after all our kindness, then strike me down now Delita.
Delita (steps back): I...
Corsa: What's the matter? Your sword is right under your feet.
Delita: I...I can't kill you. I owe you my sister's life.
Corsa: Then what is this silliness about treason? Even if your heart says otherwise, you are already a traitor for being in my debt. I am no less a traitor to the Death Corps for offering it. We may as well be traitors together.
Delita: Promise me, Corsa, that you won't interfere with our mission. If you do, I'll kill you myself.
Corsa: You have my word.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 8

Ft. Zeakden
(Ramza and Delita enter at the side of the fort. A Hokuten Knight stands near the door.)
Ramza: There's no sign of fighting. Is everything already over? (Zalbag appears near the Hokuten Knight.)
Delita: Shh! Something's up.
Hokuten Knight: General Zalbag, a bunch of enemies just fled back into the fort. ONe of them looked like the leader, Sixe.
Zalbag: All right, then, let's go on in.
Hokuten Knight: Yes, sir! (The two enter as Corsa and Teta appear behind Ramza and Delita.)
Ramza: You don't think Sixe followed us here?
Delita (shakes his head): If he did, we would have seen him pass us. No, whoever Zalbag saw must have been a fake. It could even be trap! We need to warn him!
Ramza: Corsa, we part here. Watch over Teta for us, OK? (Corsa nods.)
Ramza and Delita run towards the fort's entrance, but the two pause as they hear a scream.
Delita: Teta! Damnit, I knew we should have never took her with us!
Ramza and Delita rush back to see Corsa on the floor, a dead yellow chocobo near her, two dead Hokuten knights near Algus, and Algus pointing his crossbow at Teta.
Teta: No, no don't shoot! Help! (Nudges Corsa.)
Corsa: F-f-fa...
Algus: Stop pleading with me, you peasant trash. You're a traitor, just like that bitch beside you! 
Delita: Algus, you bastard! You wanna die?! (Delita rushes at Algus as he fires his crossbow, killing Delita, but his forward momentum bowls Algus over.
Ramza: Delita, no! (Ramza is too shocked to move. As Algus pushes Delita's corpse off him, Corsa rises and Ramza, coming to his senses, rushes over to Delita).
Corsa: Teta, get inside the fortress and lock the door. It's not safe right now. (Teta nods and flees into the fort.)
Ramza: Algus, what are you doing? Don't you realize what you've just done?
Algus: So you'd betray us too? Or are you so spoiled you think yourself above your own family?
Ramza: Delita was my best friend. Algus, your life is forfeit! (Algus backs up from Ramza.)
Algus: Hmph, have it your way, then! (Algus whistles and a Hokuten squad appears.) Kill them! They're traitors against our Lord and the Crown!

Algus Turn 1:
Algus: YOU! How are you still standing? My last shot...
Corsa: Thank you, Father. Please grant me the strength to execute your will, Farlem.
Algus: Pray all you like, you softie! You couldn't kill me if you tried!
Corsa: You are no soldier.
Algus: I am a better soldier than you could ever be! I am Algus Sidalfus, a son of Limberry. You are nothing before...
Corsa: No wonder...

Ramza Turn 1:
Ramza: Algus, have you gone mad? Do you want to make my brothers your enemy!
Algus (points at Corsa): Then why are you defending her before me? She's my enemy and an enemy of the Belouves!
Ramza: Not every Death Corps is a kidnapping scoundrel! Teta owes her life to our collaboration!
Algus: Listen to yourself, stupid! You've been taken in by her and you don't even know it! Peasants like them die all the time without a trace in history. Is it so outrageous to add another corpse?
Ramza: So Delita's rank justifies your murder? Never!

Algus Turn 2:
Algus: You are unworthy to even hold a sword before me, you mongrel!
Corsa: Better a peasant than a traitor.
Algus: MY FAMILY IS NOT...MY GRANDFATHER DIDN'T...
Corsa: Save your breath. Your grandfather was the first commander my...my father...ever had. He...was promoted for killing Lord Sidalfus, the defector. (OOC: Is this too coincidental? It badly reeks of original sin and "destined enemy" motifs that I'd rather avoid, but...I don't see a better way for Corsa to totally destroy Algus' pride. If possible, we can also tie in the "Balbanes did not issue immoral orders" bit into this by having Lord Sidalfus be the one who falsely claimed to have royal authority to commit all kinds of misdeeds, and tried to defect when military encirclement by Ordallia and the prospect of court-martial by Ivalice made him choose the "lesser evil", but...that may be stretching it too far.) 
Algus: YOU...YOU LIAR!!! On my...no, my family's honor, I'll shoot out your heart and rip you limb from limb! No one tells lies like that to my face!!!
Corsa: F-Forgive me, Father, for my weakness. Your death will not be in vain.

Ramza Turn 2:
Ramza: Brother Zalbag may love victory, but he also loves honor. Would you dare repeat what you just told me about Delita's death?
Algus: This is war. He could have died just as easily from a Death Corps sniper. The snow will bury his body soon and no one will be the wiser!
Ramza: So even my brother is beneath you, Algus?
Algus: Shut up! Ramza, you're no Belouve; you lost that the moment you gave your heart to that whore besides you!
Corsa: What a disgrace. Ramza, let's end his misery.
Ramza: (OOC: I can't tell what he should say here.)

Algus Death:
Algus: Damn you...How could I be beaten by weaklings like you?

Aftermath (OOC: Golagros may be a little too over-the-top and anachronistic. Adjust, please):
Ramza (staring at Delita's corpse): Delita...I'm sorry. (Ramza kneels and cries.)
Corsa (placing her hand on Ramza): You weren't the only one...(Golagros emerges with Teta firmly grasped in hand.)
Teta: Let me go! Help!
Golagros: You let the prisoner out?
Corsa: Yes.
Golagros: Why the hell do you always fuck with my plans, Corsa? Why you gotta make life so difficult?
Corsa: When will you grow a heart, Golagros? Just because we are fighting a war doesn't mean we can commit every possible crime to our enemies!
Golagros (laughs): Grow up, you pansy! You just got lucky that I didn't need her to cover my ass. (Pushes Teta aside)
Ramza: What do you mean? What's going on?
Golagros: Why the hell is he here?
Corsa: It's none of your concern.
Golagros: If I were the boss...I'd slap you silly every time you talk smack, bitch. But I'm in a good mood, the fort's gonna blow! We hit the jackpot!
Ramza: What?! My brother's still in there! Zalbag! (Ramza now stands up.)
Golagros: What, you ain't gonna stop him, Corsa?
Corsa (pushes Ramza): Go, Ramza, you don't have time.
Ramza: But...
Corsa: You can thank me later. (Ramza runs off towards the other door.)
Golagros: The hell? You want that punk messin' up the whole thing? Why I oughtta...(withdraws his saber)
Corsa (withdraws her sword): I don't want to fight you, Golagros, but if I must...
Golagros: Whose side are you on, anyways?! (The fort shakes, as Ramza stumbles. Golagros looks up and smirks.) Screw this, we've won. Let's go, boys. (Rides off with his men. The fort explodes.)
Ramza: ZALBAAGGG!!!!
