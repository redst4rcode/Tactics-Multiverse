Farmhouse in Fovoham
Ramza (gets up from bed): I'm ready to go now.
Corsa (standing by the door): Ramza, please stay. You've been so blinded by that vision that you've forgotten its source.
Ramza: Are you questioning the Will of God, Corsa?
Corsa: No, I'd never, but...what if this vision is just mere sorcery?
Ramza: But...
Corsa: You say that your brother pulled out a green gem after your duel. Right after, you heard Ajora tell you to find the Holy Stones. What if your brother's gem was actually a Stone?
Ramza: No, that's not possible. He's not worthy to even touch the Stones, much less use it.
Corsa: I never said he was a Zodiac Brave. That would be blasphemy, but he could have stolen the Stone from its rightful owner.
Ramza: I know what you're doing! You're saying all this because you want me to join the Death Corps and attack Igros! Well, I'm not your pawn, Corsa! I won't...
Corsa: So is that why all your men tell me you're going to Riovanes instead? Either way, you're still helping us.
Ramza (scowls): I'm not doing it for you or your damned husband! I have my own plan and you'd better not get in my way!
Corsa (sighs): All I'm saying is that if your brother has the Stone, he could have easily produced a lying vision. If you base your plans off that, you will only destroy yourself!
Ramza: I know the real thing when I see it, Corsa. What I saw WAS Ajora. Unlike you, my faith did not die in rebellion.
Corsa (stares coldly at Ramza before sighing): I grew up in the Church. I've felt her holiness too, but many in the Church today lack her righteousness. (Produces a book and puts it on the the counter.) Ramza, I want you to have this.
Ramza: What is it?
Corsa: It's a diary of my former pastor. It lists...the sins of his colleagues. Many of those men still hold influence within the Church. (Corsa turns to leave, abruptly.)
Ramza: Something wrong?
Corsa: I just hope that after you read it, you will not think poorly of me. Please remember me, Ramza, when they come for you. (She leaves.)

Clearing near Riovanes
Golagros: What are you doing here, kid?
Ramza: The same as you. I am here to defeat Lord Barinten, to avenge....(Golagros withdraws his calvalry saber and points it at Ramza's throat.)
Golagros: Shut yer trap, noble! You think I believe that? You may be able to fool a softie like Corsa, but you ain't foolin' me! Why are you REALLY here?
Rafa: Mister Golagros...Ramza can help us. Didn't you just say that we don't have the numbers?
Golagros: Shut up, bitch. I don't care if he has a whole fuckin' army, I don't trust 'im!
Malak: Well, I do! I'm alive because of him! (Puts a dagger inches from Golagros' face.) You say one more thing about my sister and I'll shove this up your skull!
Rafa: Malak, no! (She tries to pull Malak away but he pushes her off.)
Golagros: I'm the one in charge here, Malak. You better...
Malak: We don't have the time for this! Rafa and I just got back from Yuguo. They're gathering reserves to break our siege.
Golagros: Shit! How close are they? How many?
Malak: Put your weapon away first.
Golagros (scowls): Fine. (Sheaths his saber; Malak puts away his dagger.)
Malak: Normally, a march through the Woods shouldn't take long, but we cut their supplies. They're stuck until they send another wagon team.
Golagros: At least a day, then. That'll be enough for my Raiders to crush 'em! (Turns to leave.) Malak, the punk's yours. Keep yer eyes peeled.
Malak: Yes...sir. (OOC: The sir is meant to be ironic.) (Golagros exits on his chocobo.) Ramza, that IS why you're here, right? To help us defeat...
Ramza: Yes, of course. (OOC: Ramza says this rather hurriedly, maybe smaller font?) But now we're even shorter on men. How will we get in?
Rafa: As assassins, Malak and I can easily scale walls, but there's guards everywhere. Just like Igros, we'll need a distraction to get in.
Ramza: So that's where my squad comes in?
Rafa: Yes, you and Malak.
Malak: Rafa, I thought we already talked about this. You don't go without me!
Rafa: This is my fight, Malak.
Malak: But...(Rafa turns away.)
Rafa: YOU KNOW what he did to me! I KNOW YOU KNOW!
Malak: ...
Rafa: Please, Malak, don't worry for me. I was helpless then, but I'm not so weak anymore. Barinten will be our last fight, but as Khamja, we were to never fear death, remember?
Malak (chuckling): So serious, Rafa. For once, you care about the mission more than I do.
Rafa: I never had a reason to care. Not until now...(warps away)
Ramza: What was all that...(Malak gently hits Ramza in the back with his palm.)
Malak: Com'on, Ramza. Let's go!

Gate of Riovanes
Ramza and Malak are currently off-screen, revealing only their words.
Ramza: I still don't get something.
Malak: Yes?
Ramza: If all it took is one squad to distract the defenders, then why didn't you have Golagros do it?  Why me?
Malak: Deception is our trade. You think I'm gonna let a fool like Golagros have any kind of power in Riovanes? 
Ramza: But...that means...
Malak: The Army is being held up by a friend of ours who can talk to beasts. The whole story about supply lines is fake. Once Golagros goes into the woods, he and the Army will exhaust each other and we'll mop up both of them.
Ramza: ...Is this truly necessary?
Malak: You'd rather him take over and declare this whole area a Death Corps "free zone"? So he can create another Zeakden?
Ramza: Did Rafa really agree to this?
Malak: This whole scheme was her idea, not mine. Once she believes something, it's often impossible to change her mind.
Ramza: ...Alma....(Ramza and Malak appear on screen.)

(Save Screen)

Prebattle:
RAmza: So this is Riovanes. It's not as big as Igros, but it looks much more imposing.
Malak: Don't lose heart, Ramza, Rafa's counting on us.
Unknown Knight: So the rumors are true. You've betrayed us, Malak!
Malak: It was the best decision I ever made. As your commander, Milly, I order you to stand down!
Milly: I don't yield for traitors. If you and your friend want to enter the castle, you'll have to go through me.
Malak: Don't worry, I wouldn't have it any other way!

Turn 1 (Milly):
Milly: I don't have all day. If you're going to attack, just do it already!
Malak: You mean to tell me you haven't the courage to attack me yourself? Your words are empty, Milly!
Milly: Me, scared? Never! As an Iron Knight, I can take anything! It's you who's being a chicken without Rafa at your side!
Malak: Rafa...will be fine!
Milly: Oh really? Then perhaps she can join in on the fun. I'd love to pay her back for all that she owes me!
Malak: She owes you nothing! Worry about your own fate.
Milly (laughs): *My* fate is to defend this gate for Barinten. *Your* fate is to be cut down by my blade!
Malak: Come, then! On the honor of the Khamja, I'll cut you to pieces! (Change Milly's AI to aggressive, target Malak.)

Turn 2 (MAlak):
Malak: You don't stand a chance, Milly! No one likes a tenacious loser who is as flat as she is useless!
Milly: !!!
Malak: What's the matter? Can't handle the truth?
Milly: Truth? Hell Knight, don't make laugh. You haven't the truth in you! You and Rafa have always been in MY way, ALWAYS! He was MINE, you hear? I LOVE him and a child like Rafa can never compare...
Malak: I...(begins to laugh)...so is that it? You're fighting me for HIM? ARe you really that suicidal?! Milly, do you even have an idea what kind of man he is? What he did to Rafa?
Milly: THAT DAMNED MOUTH OF YOURS WON'T OPEN AGAIN! DIE!
Riovanes Knight: Commander, uhh, ma'am, our orders aren't...
Milly: SHUT UP, GRUNT! NOBODY ASKED YOU! JUST KILL HIM! (Change all units' AI to aggressive, target Malak.)
