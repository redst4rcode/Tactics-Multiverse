4 Bits = Actual Range
0xF = 255 Range
functions as +Range if weapon ranged is flagged

REST-(VAL+1) Stat change, VAL * 10 + 10 for Loy / Cor changes, VAL * 10 + 15 for CT changes, if VAL = 7, then CT change is max

MP
4 Bits = VAL * 5 = MP Cost
2 Bits:
0 = Normal
1 = Primary Proc if KO target
2 = Primary Proc if evaded / bad RNG (if an attack is evadable and has innate inaccuracy, this check applies only to evasion)
3 = If Secondary Proc works, no primary
2 Bits:
0 = Normal
1 = Secondary Proc if KO target
2 = Secondary Proc if evaded / bad RNG (if an attack is evadable and has innate inaccuracy, this check applies only to evasion)
