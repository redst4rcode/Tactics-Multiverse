Reject Sixe / Corsa causes Delita and Ramza to split apart because Delita surrenders to Corsa to save Teta and Ramza refuses, tries to attack Corsa and is struck down.  (Delita later joins the Death Corps and Ramza remains in the Hokuten begins to adopt views more similar to Algus).  Sixe's gambit fails (see path d) and his commandos switch to a secondary plan.

Ramza is lead away from the Hokuten by Anabelle.

Mission 4: Slums of Dorter Trade City

Cloaked Man: You're kidding, right?
Death Corps 1: We've had enough of you, and a change of management is in order.
Cloaked Man: So you'd rather stain your hands in blood rather than dirt? What kind of men are you?
Death Corps 2: We want to go forward, not backwards! My father toiled his whole life to buy our family's freedom. What makes you think I'd willingly return to the land as your serf, to work at your bidding?
Cloaked Man: Can't you see I am fighting in the same cause as your father? If we succeed, no one will ever again need to buy the freedom that is his birthright! Progress is a world where nobles and merchants have nothing beneath them and the peasant has no one above him. It is not a world where everyone fights to be a noble; oppression will simply grow back under another name. 
Death Corps 3: You're just chasing phantoms! There's always gonna be stupid people; if we don't take advantage, someone else will! (Draws their weapons)
Cloaked Man: You're right; as long as cruel and heartless fools like you lot exist, there can be no peace! (Cloaked Man draws his sword as Ramza, Delita, and Algus enter.) In the name of all, I will bury you under my feet!
(Enter Ramza, Delita, and Algus)
Ramza: What's going on here? Why is that man being attacked?
Algus: Must be the spy, leave him to his fate.
Delita: If that's the case, perhaps we should save him, Ramza? Your brother would be pleased to have what information he has.
Ramza: Good point, Delita. Let's go, save this man from the Death Corps!
Cloaked Man's Turn:
Cloaked Man: Traitors on one side, the Hokuten on the other. The Bear and the Lion are at each other's necks!
Ramza: Don't worry, we'll help you!
Cloaked Man: is he talking to me, or them? (OOC: I don't like this line, but I'm not sure how to fix it. (Myrm) line's flavour rather than content - theoretically unsure as to who Ramza's attacking. I can change/remove it, no problem.)

Post Battle:
Ramza: Are you unharmed?
Cloaked Man: Essentially.
Algus: Better than you deserve. So are you going to hand over the information, or no?
Cloaked Man: I don't have time for these games.
Algus: Why you little...(Delita holds Algus back; Algus's line here and Delita's restraint come as an interruption, and shouldn't stop the flow of Sixe's text)
Cloaked Man: The biggest rat is still hiding in the Sandy Cellar. He goes by the name of Gustav and he alone kidnapped Elmdor. [Rides away] (OOC: Builds the suspense, leads into Sixe's plot, and shows that Sixe is the one commanding the tempo of the negotiations.)
Ramza: Wait! How do know that? Wait! (Algus shakes Delita off)
Algus: I don't get it. Who's this Gustav?
Delita: Gustav Magueriff, a captain of the Death Corps.
Algus: Fine, let's say that this animal has the information Lord Zalbag wants - where are we going, anyways?
Ramza: 'Sand Rat Cellar'.
Algus: Sand ra-a-a-ts?
Delita: Algus may not know what they are since he's not from here. "Sand Rats" only inhabit the Zeklaus Desert north of Dorter.
Algus: Wha?
Ramza: Was there a village between Dorter and Zeklaus Desert?
Delita: Not anymore. But there is a place where desert people used to gather...
Ramza: ......Gustav and the Marquis may be there.
Delita: Yes, probably.
Algus: What are you all talking about?
Ramza: The desert people are known as "Sand Rats". The "Cellar" is their nest.
Algus: ...Of course...seems only appopriate for vermin like them... (OOC: I'm not sure how else to show Algus is embarrassed for being stupid. The vanilla dialogue needs a tweak because it always seemed fairly obscure to me when I read it through.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 5: Same

After Mission 5 (Broken Down Stone Shed):
Cloaked Man (no longer wearing his hat from before): Why have you betrayed us, Gustav?
Gustav: Surprised that I took a page out of your playbook, Sixe? You think you're the only one with a brain?
Sixe: What?
Gustav: I know about the Romandian silver. How else would a shit like you rise so fast? It's time for me to give you a taste of your own medicine!
Sixe: Is this your best excuse? I'm sorry, Gustav, not even an idiot like Prince Larg would accept that.
Sixe lowers his blade. Gustav sees the opening, and takes it. (Dies as in vanilla.)
Sixe: You had so much potential, but you never once learned from your mistakes. Goodbye, Gustav.
Enter Ramza and crew.
Algus: Marquis! (Gasps) You...you're Sixe!
Sixe: (OOC: Insert Witty comment here)
Elmdor: ugghhh....
Algus: If you touch one hair on his head, I'll kill you!
Sixe (sheathes his blade): Relax. The Marqius is unhurt. Take him back to Limberry.
Algus: What?! Don't trifle with me.
Sixe: I am not your enemy. I did not order this attack. This pathetic coward (points to Gustav) was merely following the orders of Prince Larg and Lord Dycedarg. Treasonous scum like him don't deserve to live.
Ramza: What? You mean to say...my brother ordered this...?
Sixe: So you're the youngest Belouve? (Sixe reaches into his shirt and produces two folded documents.) Your pride must be hurt, but I have proof.
Algus: You're nothing but trash! You think you can beat us? You probably just made the whole...
Delita: Enough, Algus! He's serious.
Ramza: Delita, you mean...you actually believe him? Surely, Lord Brother wouldn't...
Delita: Even if it is fake, I'd rather the letters in our hands. Think of the consequences if Prince Goltana were to get ahold of them!
Algus: Don...don't be paranoid, Delita. Ramza and I both know the Prince would never believe such a ridiculous conspiracy theory. (OOC: Algus is trying to hide his stupidity and desire. He just realized Delita's fear that Sixe would give the information to Goltana via Elmdor is actually a good idea that would benefit him. AS a result, he's trying to obstruct Delita without showing his hand. Feel free to improve on this.)
Ramza: Algus's right, Delita. My brother would never do such a thing! His threats are just boasts...oof (Sixe body slams Ramza before the other two can react.)
Sixe: You're in no position to make threats, Belouve. (Sixe leaves and throws the documents contemptuously on the ground.)
Algus: Wait! Your letter! (OOC: The point here is that actions speak louder than words. The fact that Sixe does not care to play any of those political games implies he is very powerful and it immediately grabs Algus' attention. In his haste, Algus also reveals his true intent.)

Intermezzo at Igros: Same.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 6: At Thieves' Fort, you fight Corsa [my Miluda replacement and Sixe's wife]. In the pre-battle scene, she enters the fort on a yellow chocobo and takes the role of optimistic leader [while the thieves around her are the ones with doubts].
Interaction:
Priestess: Why are you nobles even fighting us? We aren't your enemy.
Algus: Humph...ridiculous. You dogs need to know in your place!
Corsa: Maybe you should know yours. We starve ourselves to feed the likes of you. We exhaust our youth to forge your weapons and fight your wars. Have you no gratitude, or at least some shame? You are ruining people no different than yourselves!
Algus: Human? These dogs were never human! They were born to serve and die for us! It's the Will of Heaven! Why don't you see this, and stop rolling in their own filth with them?
Priestess: Heaven? God would never say such things! In his eyes, we are all equal.
Algus: Animals have no God!
Priestess: !!!!
Corsa: Enough, [insert generic name here]. We aren't all pigs like him.
Algus: !!!!
Delita: Algus, calm down. Don't prove her right.

Corsa: So many innocent lives...why did we have to fight today?
Ramza: I...I...
Algus: Don't lose your resolve, Ramza! Kill her now! She's your enemy and an enemy of your family! She wants to live like a mongrel, treat her like one. How can she even be a leader? Losers cannot remain alive! Besides, if we don't kill her, she'll kill us! We cannot coexist! Kill her, Ramza, with your own hands!!!
Delita: Ramza, I don't see why she is our enemy.
Algus: What did you say?! Are you mad, Delita?
Delita: She's not an animal...She's human just like us...
Algus: Are you betraying us?! You too?! Damnit, I'll kill her myself! (lunges forward)
Corsa smiles and whistles. A yellow chocobo charges straight at Algus, who sidesteps the bird. In one motion, Corsa mounts the bird and kicks Algus. She leaves the scene leaving Algus dumbstruck.

Intermezzo at Mandalia:
Delita: Beautiful; somewhere, Teta is watching the same sunset.
Ramza: That's if she's still alive.
Delita: Ramza, she must be! I can't lose her...
Ramza: You saw how the Death Corps kill even their own. What hope would any of us have in their hands?
Delita: But why Teta? She isn't a soldier like us; what use is she as a hostage?
Ramza: All the more reason to doubt...
Delita: Teta... (Delita sobs.)
Ramza: She's my sister too. (A long pause as the wind picks up.) You're right; we can't lose hope. IT's all we have left.
Delita: Remember how Father taught us to play the grass flute? (Grass flute scene.)

Background: Custom Map -- Barn (inside)
Teta: Brother...where...where are you? Please, save me. (Teta cries)
The door creaks open and Corsa enters.
Teta (backs up a step): Y-You! Wh...what do you want?
Corsa: Relax. (Walks over). I don't mean you harm. (Extends out both hands, holding a bowl). Here, I brought you some soup.
Teta: (Drinks the soup)...I...thank you. It tastes...so familiar.
Corsa: I didn't know Belouves liked the taste of muskrat.
Teta: (turns away)...Is that what it is? When I was little...my brother and I...(sobs harder)
Corsa: You aren't a Belouve, are you?
Teta: It's...my fate. AT school, I try my hardest to pass...but they...they always see right through...(resumes sobbing)
Corsa: It isn't just you. As a child, I trained alongside nobles. After I started beating them, I was left doing their chores while they sparred.
Teta: Were you punished for their mistakes as well?
Corsa nods. Teta drains her bowl of soup. 
Corsa: Why were you living with the Belouves? You don't look like their servant.
Teta: The Belouves have been nothing but kind to me. Alma is my only friend...if she could only see me now...(resumes sobbing)
Corsa: You have no one else?
Teta: Well...I...I have my brother Delita, but he's always so busy at the Academy. I almost never see him...
Corsa: Delita...could it be? I just fought a boy in the Hokuten with that name.
Teta: You...you didn't hurt him did you? I...wouldn't know what to do if...
Corsa: He's still alive. He spared my life.
Teta (nods): That sounds like the brother I know.
Corsa: He must be worried for you. On behalf of the Death Corps, please accept my apology. (Hands Teta a key.)
Teta: Wha? You...you're freeing me? Why?
Corsa: What we did to you was wrong. Think of this as my way of repaying the debts to you and your brother.
Teta: Thanks.
Corsa: You can't leave now. There are guards everywhere. Tomorrow, when my friend comes on duty, he will approach your cell and whisper my name. That will be your signal to escape.
Teta (hugging Corsa): You never told me your name.
Corsa: My name is Corsa. You?
Teta: It's Teta.
Corsa: If all goes well, Teta, we'll see your brother together.
Teta: You promise?
Corsa: Of course. (Closes the door)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 7:

Interaction:
Corsa: Just my luck. You are Delita, correct?
Delita: Where is Teta? Where are you hiding her?!
Corsa: I will lead you to your sister if we both lay down our arms. (She places her sword onto the ground.)
Death Corps Knight: Commander, are you insane?
Corsa: Trust me, [insert random name]. We won't need to fight.
Ramza:
Option A = I don't believe you.
Option B = I made a promise to Delita.

Delita: Ramza, are you crazy?! That's my sister you're abandoning!
Ramza: We can't let her trick us like she did Algus!
Delita: Algus, Dycedarg...Ramza, how are you any different?! (Delita runs toward Corsa)
Ramza: Wait, Delita...(runs towards Corsa with sword withdrawn)
Corsa: You leave me no choice. (Corsa picks up her sword and uses Lightning Stab)
Delita takes one look back as the screen fades to black.

Screen starts black and color gradually seeps in to reveal a room with Ramza in a bed with his squad (sans Delita) around him.
Ramza: Ugh...
Male Chemist: He's awake! Thank Ajora!
Female Squire: Ramza! Are you all right?
Ramza: ...Where am I? (Scene reveals a small, cramped, disheveled room.)
Female Squire: We thought you'd never come to!
Male Chemist: Yeah, you had us so worried. What would we tell Sir Zalbag if you had died?
Ramza: Delita...where...
Female Squire: uhh...let's not...
Male Chemist: He's bound to remember what that scumbag, double-crossing "best friend" did sooner or later.
Ramza: What? What did Delita...did he actually leave us?
Male Chemist: Yeah...that lousy traitor! Algus was right; filthy rats like him would never understand us nobles!
Ramza stands up to shove Male Chemist, but doubles over in pain.
Male Chemist: come on, RAmza. You have to face reality. He didn't even look back when that bitch struck you down. He abandoned you, Ramza.
Female Squire: That's enough. Don't you think Ramza's had it hard enough already?
Male Chemist: The truth never hurt anybody...
Female Squire 2: Ramza! Come quick! There's a bunch of suspicious people outside!
Ramza (carefully stands back up): All right...let's go!
Ramza leaves the room slowly, after everyone else.

~Magic City Gariland (Main Street)
Cavalry Commander: Come on. Faster! The night guards will soon be here!
Rider: Golagros, sir...what's that? (Points off towards the side of the street away from the map.)
Cavalry Commander Golagros: You gotta be kiddin' me! Already?! You get yer asses off to Dorter. I'll take 'em.
Rider: Yes, sir! (All 3 riders ride off as Golagros rides towards the side of the street, but Ramza hobbles out of the nearest building.)
Ramza: In the name of the Hokuten, drop your arms and surrender! You have nowhere to run!
Golagros: Are the Hokuten this desperate to send kids at me?! You ain't gotta chance! (Golagros turns towards the grassy side of the canal and rushes at Ramza with his cavalry saber; Ramza blocks, but the speed of his charge bowls Ramza over. Ramza's squad shows up behind Golagros as he falls.)
Male Chemist: Commander! (Ramza stirs only for Golagros to dismount and kick him unconscious.) You Death Corps scum!
Golagros: If your commander couldn't stop me, how's a grunt like you gonna?
Male Chemist: We've blocked off your escape. You have no place to run!
Golagros: Shut up! You ain't in a position to make threats! (Male Chemist edges towards Golagros, who points his saber at Ramza's head.) Back off, or he dies!
Male Chemist: I don't fear a pathetic terrorist like you! (Male Chemist charges at Golagros, who responds with a back hop and a whistle. His chocobo counterrushes the Chemist, knocks him down, and begins to peck at him.) Arrgh!! My eyes!!
Golagros: Well? What will it be? The rest of you wanna die like that?
Female Squire: Ramza is our commander. If he dies, we'll all die with him! (Battles starts as 5v2 with Ramza and the male chemist KO'd.)

Victory:
Golagros: So this is how it ends?
