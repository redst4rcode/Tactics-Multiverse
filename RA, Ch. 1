Reject Sixe / Accept Corsa causes Delita and Ramza to arrive at Zeakden to find that the fighting is now inside the fort. They venture inside to find Zalbag dueling what seems to be Sixe (really his body double). Zalbag tells him to leave him alone (because he is expecting reinforcements) and hurry down to the deepest chamber where Ramza fights the commandos Sixe dispatched to blow up the fort with Zalbag inside. Their victory ensures Zalbag's survival and as they exit the fort, they see Algus shoot a cornered Golagros.

Mission 4: Slums of Dorter Trade City

Cloaked Man: You're kidding, right?
Death Corps 1: We've had enough of you, and a change of management is in order.
Cloaked Man: So you'd rather stain your hands in blood rather than dirt? What kind of men are you?
Death Corps 2: We want to go forward, not backwards! My father toiled his whole life to buy our family's freedom. What makes you think I'd willingly return to the land as your serf, to work at your bidding?
Cloaked Man: Can't you see I am fighting in the same cause as your father? If we succeed, no one will ever again need to buy the freedom that is his birthright! Progress is a world where nobles and merchants have nothing beneath them and the peasant has no one above him. It is not a world where everyone fights to be a noble; oppression will simply grow back under another name. 
Death Corps 3: You're just chasing phantoms! There's always gonna be stupid people; if we don't take advantage, someone else will! (Draws their weapons)
Cloaked Man: You're right; as long as cruel and heartless fools like you lot exist, there can be no peace! (Cloaked Man draws his sword as Ramza, Delita, and Algus enter.) In the name of all, I will bury you under my feet!
(Enter Ramza, Delita, and Algus)
Ramza: What's going on here? Why is that man being attacked?
Algus: Must be the spy, leave him to his fate.
Delita: If that's the case, perhaps we should save him, Ramza? Your brother would be pleased to have what information he has.
Ramza: Good point, Delita. Let's go, save this man from the Death Corps!
Cloaked Man's Turn:
Cloaked Man: Traitors on one side, the Hokuten on the other. The Bear and the Lion are at each other's necks!
Ramza: Don't worry, we'll help you!
Cloaked Man: is he talking to me, or them? (OOC: I don't like this line, but I'm not sure how to fix it. (Myrm) line's flavour rather than content - theoretically unsure as to who Ramza's attacking. I can change/remove it, no problem.)

Post Battle:
Ramza: Are you unharmed?
Cloaked Man: Essentially.
Algus: Better than you deserve. So are you going to hand over the information, or no?
Cloaked Man: I don't have time for these games.
Algus: Why you little...(Delita holds Algus back; Algus's line here and Delita's restraint come as an interruption, and shouldn't stop the flow of Sixe's text)
Cloaked Man: The biggest rat is still hiding in the Sandy Cellar. He goes by the name of Gustav and he alone kidnapped Elmdor. [Rides away] (OOC: Builds the suspense, leads into Sixe's plot, and shows that Sixe is the one commanding the tempo of the negotiations.)
Ramza: Wait! How do know that? Wait! (Algus shakes Delita off)
Algus: I don't get it. Who's this Gustav?
Delita: Gustav Magueriff, a captain of the Death Corps.
Algus: Fine, let's say that this animal has the information Lord Zalbag wants - where are we going, anyways?
Ramza: 'Sand Rat Cellar'.
Algus: Sand ra-a-a-ts?
Delita: Algus may not know what they are since he's not from here. "Sand Rats" only inhabit the Zeklaus Desert north of Dorter.
Algus: Wha?
Ramza: Was there a village between Dorter and Zeklaus Desert?
Delita: Not anymore. But there is a place where desert people used to gather...
Ramza: ......Gustav and the Marquis may be there.
Delita: Yes, probably.
Algus: What are you all talking about?
Ramza: The desert people are known as "Sand Rats". The "Cellar" is their nest.
Algus: ...Of course...seems only appopriate for vermin like them... (OOC: I'm not sure how else to show Algus is embarrassed for being stupid. The vanilla dialogue needs a tweak because it always seemed fairly obscure to me when I read it through.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 5: Same

After Mission 5 (Broken Down Stone Shed):
Cloaked Man (no longer wearing his hat from before): Why have you betrayed us, Gustav?
Gustav: Surprised that I took a page out of your playbook, Sixe? You think you're the only one with a brain?
Sixe: What?
Gustav: I know about the Romandian silver. How else would a shit like you rise so fast? It's time for me to give you a taste of your own medicine!
Sixe: Is this your best excuse? I'm sorry, Gustav, not even an idiot like Prince Larg would accept that.
Sixe lowers his blade. Gustav sees the opening, and takes it. (Dies as in vanilla.)
Sixe: You had so much potential, but you never once learned from your mistakes. Goodbye, Gustav.
Enter Ramza and crew.
Algus: Marquis! (Gasps) You...you're Sixe!
Sixe: (OOC: Insert Witty comment here)
Elmdor: ugghhh....
Algus: If you touch one hair on his head, I'll kill you!
Sixe (sheathes his blade): Relax. The Marqius is unhurt. Take him back to Limberry.
Algus: What?! Don't trifle with me.
Sixe: I am not your enemy. I did not order this attack. This pathetic coward (points to Gustav) was merely following the orders of Prince Larg and Lord Dycedarg. Treasonous scum like him don't deserve to live.
Ramza: What? You mean to say...my brother ordered this...?
Sixe: So you're the youngest Belouve? (Sixe reaches into his shirt and produces two folded documents.) Your pride must be hurt, but I have proof.
Algus: You're nothing but trash! You think you can beat us? You probably just made the whole...
Delita: Enough, Algus! He's serious.
Ramza: Delita, you mean...you actually believe him? Surely, Lord Brother wouldn't...
Delita: Even if it is fake, I'd rather the letters in our hands. Think of the consequences if Prince Goltana were to get ahold of them!
Algus: Don...don't be paranoid, Delita. Ramza and I both know the Prince would never believe such a ridiculous conspiracy theory. (OOC: Algus is trying to hide his stupidity and desire. He just realized Delita's fear that Sixe would give the information to Goltana via Elmdor is actually a good idea that would benefit him. AS a result, he's trying to obstruct Delita without showing his hand. Feel free to improve on this.)
Ramza: Algus's right, Delita. My brother would never do such a thing! His threats are just boasts...oof (Sixe body slams Ramza before the other two can react.)
Sixe: You're in no position to make threats, Belouve. (Sixe leaves and throws the documents contemptuously on the ground.)
Algus: Wait! Your letter! (OOC: The point here is that actions speak louder than words. The fact that Sixe does not care to play any of those political games implies he is very powerful and it immediately grabs Algus' attention. In his haste, Algus also reveals his true intent.)

Intermezzo at Igros: Same.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 6: At Thieves' Fort, you fight Corsa [my Miluda replacement and Sixe's wife]. In the pre-battle scene, she enters the fort on a yellow chocobo and takes the role of optimistic leader [while the thieves around her are the ones with doubts].
Interaction:
Priestess: Why are you nobles even fighting us? We aren't your enemy.
Algus: Humph...ridiculous. You dogs need to know in your place!
Corsa: Maybe you should know yours. We starve ourselves to feed the likes of you. We exhaust our youth to forge your weapons and fight your wars. Have you no gratitude, or at least some shame? You are ruining people no different than yourselves!
Algus: Human? These dogs were never human! They were born to serve and die for us! It's the Will of Heaven! Why don't you see this, and stop rolling in their own filth with them?
Priestess: Heaven? God would never say such things! In his eyes, we are all equal.
Algus: Animals have no God!
Priestess: !!!!
Corsa: Enough, [insert generic name here]. We aren't all pigs like him.
Algus: !!!!
Delita: Algus, calm down. Don't prove her right.

Corsa: So many innocent lives...why did we have to fight today?
Ramza: I...I...
Algus: Don't lose your resolve, Ramza! Kill her now! She's your enemy and an enemy of your family! She wants to live like a mongrel, treat her like one. How can she even be a leader? Losers cannot remain alive! Besides, if we don't kill her, she'll kill us! We cannot coexist! Kill her, Ramza, with your own hands!!!
Delita: Ramza, I don't see why she is our enemy.
Algus: What did you say?! Are you mad, Delita?
Delita: She's not an animal...She's human just like us...
Algus: Are you betraying us?! You too?! Damnit, I'll kill her myself! (lunges forward)
Corsa smiles and whistles. A yellow chocobo charges straight at Algus, who sidesteps the bird. In one motion, Corsa mounts the bird and kicks Algus. She leaves the scene leaving Algus dumbstruck.

Intermezzo at Mandalia:
Delita: Beautiful; somewhere, Teta is watching the same sunset.
Ramza: That's if she's still alive.
Delita: Ramza, she must be! I can't lose her...
Ramza: You saw how the Death Corps kill even their own. What hope would any of us have in their hands?
Delita: But why Teta? She isn't a soldier like us; what use is she as a hostage?
Ramza: All the more reason to doubt...
Delita: Teta... (Delita sobs.)
Ramza: She's my sister too. (A long pause as the wind picks up.) You're right; we can't lose hope. IT's all we have left.
Delita: Remember how Father taught us to play the grass flute? (Grass flute scene.)

Background: Custom Map -- Barn (inside)
Teta: Brother...where...where are you? Please, save me. (Teta cries)
The door creaks open and Corsa enters.
Teta (backs up a step): Y-You! Wh...what do you want?
Corsa: Relax. (Walks over). I don't mean you harm. (Extends out both hands, holding a bowl). Here, I brought you some soup.
Teta: (Drinks the soup)...I...thank you. It tastes...so familiar.
Corsa: I didn't know Belouves liked the taste of muskrat.
Teta: (turns away)...Is that what it is? When I was little...my brother and I...(sobs harder)
Corsa: You aren't a Belouve, are you?
Teta: It's...my fate. AT school, I try my hardest to pass...but they...they always see right through...(resumes sobbing)
Corsa: It isn't just you. As a child, I trained alongside nobles. After I started beating them, I was left doing their chores while they sparred.
Teta: Were you punished for their mistakes as well?
Corsa nods. Teta drains her bowl of soup. 
Corsa: Why were you living with the Belouves? You don't look like their servant.
Teta: The Belouves have been nothing but kind to me. Alma is my only friend...if she could only see me now...(resumes sobbing)
Corsa: You have no one else?
Teta: Well...I...I have my brother Delita, but he's always so busy at the Academy. I almost never see him...
Corsa: Delita...could it be? I just fought a boy in the Hokuten with that name.
Teta: You...you didn't hurt him did you? I...wouldn't know what to do if...
Corsa: He's still alive. He spared my life.
Teta (nods): That sounds like the brother I know.
Corsa: He must be worried for you. On behalf of the Death Corps, please accept my apology. (Hands Teta a key.)
Teta: Wha? You...you're freeing me? Why?
Corsa: What we did to you was wrong. Think of this as my way of repaying the debts to you and your brother.
Teta: Thanks.
Corsa: You can't leave now. There are guards everywhere. Tomorrow, when my friend comes on duty, he will approach your cell and whisper my name. That will be your signal to escape.
Teta (hugging Corsa): You never told me your name.
Corsa: My name is Corsa. You?
Teta: It's Teta.
Corsa: If all goes well, Teta, we'll see your brother together.
Teta: You promise?
Corsa: Of course. (Closes the door)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 7:

Interaction:
Corsa: Just my luck. You are Delita, correct?
Delita: Where is Teta? Where are you hiding her?!
Corsa: I will lead you to your sister if we both lay down our arms. (She places her sword onto the ground.)
Death Corps Knight: Commander, are you insane?
Corsa: Trust me, [insert random name]. We won't need to fight.
Ramza:
Option A = I don't believe you.
Option B = I made a promise to Delita.

Corsa: Let's hurry.
Delita: Teta... (Skip the battle.)

Fovoham Plains
Sixe: Corsa, what are you doing here?
Corsa: Sixe, I...
Sixe: Were you the one who sent Slim back to base?
Corsa: Yes, I sent him to free our prisoner.
Sixe: Do you realize what you are risking? The Hokuten are already mobilizing! We cannot weaken our own defenses!
Corsa: I promised I would free her today, Sixe.
Sixe: Corsa, I already have plans for that. You don't need to involve yourself.
Delita: That's my sister we're talking about! Let her go!
Sixe: Corsa...why are these cadets here? Explain yourself (Sixe withdraws his sword), or...
Corsa: Sixe, we have no need to fight. Delita simply wants to see his sister.
Sixe: He may be a boy, but he is also a soldier in the Hokuten. Corsa, we cannot have mercy for our enemies.
Corsa: Am I your enemy?
Sixe: Corsa, if you insist on disobeying orders...then you give me no choice.
Corsa: Sixe, we always have a choice. When Ordallia came for my sword, I had the choice to join them. WAs I wrong, Sixe, for refusing?
Sixe: No.
Corsa: These boys had orders to kill me, but they chose to join me in saving TEta. Were they wrong, Sixe, for their mercy?
Sixe: No, but...
Corsa: You knew that we had no excuse for kidnapping Teta, much less keeping her. And yet, she is still trapped inside a barn and I'm now the traitor. Don't you also have a choice, Sixe?
Sixe: Corsa, but my orders...
Corsa: Your orders come from the trust we all put in you! It's why I joined you! Please...don't abuse it! (Walks near Sixe.)
Sixe (sheathes his sword): Corsa, please, just don't make me regret this. Promise me that you'll be careful.
Corsa: Of course, Sixe. You can count on me.

Lenalia Plateau (late afternoon):
Slim: I'm back, Corsa. (releases Teta, who runs towards Delita) Did you miss me?
Teta: Delita!
Delita: Sister! (hugs tightly) I missed you.
Teta: Oh Delita! (Hugs Delita) I was so scared!
Delita: Me too, Sister. You're safe now; there's nothing to fear.
Teta: Delita, I never want to part from you again
Slim: Aww...Corsa, isn't this cute?
Corsa: Shush...Slim. If you were locked up for a while, you'd be no different with me.
Slim: You'd never let that happen...(looks away)
Delita: I'm sorry, Teta...
Teta: About what?
Delita: I can't promise you that. I still have battles to fight.
Teta: You are leaving me?
Delita: I can't take you into battle, Teta. I can't risk losing you again.
Teta: Delita... Don't leave me again...(begins to cry)
Corsa: Teta, don't cry. Were you scared when I was with you?
Teta: No....you were so nice to me.
Corsa: Then why don't you come with me? I'll make sure you'll have a safe road home. Let's leave the fighting to the boys.
Teta: But...Delita...I...
Delita (lets go of Teta): Teta, I promise you I'll come back alive.
Teta: Really, Brother? (Delita nods.)
Delita: I'm trusting you with her life, Corsa. Don't let us down.
Corsa: Of course. (Corsa turns to leave with Teta)
Slim: Hey wait! Corsa! I had to risk my neck to get her out, you know! You owe me big time!
Corsa: Slim, don't extort me with your bad jokes.
Slim: Oh...come on, Corsa! Can't you lighten up, just for a night?! (Corsa walks away with Teta) Hey!!! Wait!! I'm being serious here! Who's going to help you find the roads? It's not like a wanted gal like yourself is just going to be waltzing into Belouve Manor untouched!
Corsa: As long as you behave, you're welcome to join us. (The three leave together.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mission 8
Fort Zeakden

~Outside of Ft. Zeakden
(Ramza and Delita enter at the side of the fort.)
Ramza: There's no sign of fighting. Is everything already over?
Delita (places his ear to the door): I still hear sounds inside.
Ramza: Then let's go.

~Tower of Ft. Zeakden
Death Corps Archer: Intruders spotted!
Death Corps Fencer: They're just a bunch of children. Is this all the mighty Hokuten have left?
Death Corps Lancer: They're also the tip of Hokuten spear. Remember, we must hold out until the plan is complete. Until then, no one is to pass.

Ramza Turn 1:
Ramza: Just give up. WE have you surrounded.
Death Corps Fencer: Surrender won't do us any good. If we did that, we would have all died before you lads were born.
Delita: You all are veterans?
Death Corps Archer: Aye, and tossed out like all the other conscripts when this country went bankrupt. We get the boot, and not a single goldsmith loses a penny.

Delita Turn 1:
Delita: What is this...plan? What can you hope to gain by stalling to your deaths?
Death Corps Lancer: If we die, you will die with us.
Delita: Not if I can help it.
Death Corps Lancer: Our deaths mean nothing before the ultimate victory! This fort is alive with our presence. Once we awaken its fire, we shall bury you!

Ramza Turn 2:
Ramza: Your misfortune isn't our fault. We lost the last war and the reparations...
Death Corps Archer: Boy, you don't know a damned thing! We had Ordallia's top commanders runnin' scared. Their mid-rankers were disappearing by the dozen every week. Fact is, we didn't lose that war, and maybe if we had another two years, we would have pushed them all the way back!
Ramza: The past is past. Why think about the last war when we're now at peace?
Death Corps Archer: Take that silver spoon outta yer mouth, boy. We conscripts were promised five years of wages for our service and for it, we risked our lives for victory. By accepting the defeat, you nobles sold us out. Every penny of our wages is now going to the enemy as reparations!

Ramza Turn 3:
Ramza: The war couldn't have gone on! Entire families died, went into debt, or starved. Are you so selfish as to ignore their pain?
Death Corps Brawler: You dumb chickenshit! You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for men like me! Ivalice was saved by us peasants learning to be soldiers. Your fathers robbed us in fear of our new freedom! After we beat back the Ordalian bastards, there's no way we would have gone back to being your serfs!
Ramza: My father Balbanes never feared anyone! He believed everyone deserved what they were due! He never would have...
Death Corps Fencer: Let's be fair, now. Balbanes was a good man, but he was blind. So were we back then. Neither he nor us won that last war, because someone else snuck behind all our backs and stole the prize!
Ramza: Wha..What do you mean?
Death Corps Fencer: Behind the throne stood the goldsmiths and their vendors to the royal family. They were so greedy they lent to both Ivalice and Ordallia without any fear! After I was dismissed from the army, I joined the Home Guard and fought with Sixe against those monsters. At our high point, hundreds of ex-soldiers were joining us, noble and peasant. We were growing so fast that we scared those traitors into ending the war to save themselves.
Ramza: (OOC: Not sure what to say here. I'd imagine the cognitive dissonance would leave Ramza speechless)

End of Battle:
Ramza: Such hatred...do you think all that actually happened, Delita?
Delita: Seems a little far-fetched, but...
Someone's Voice: Urggh...Sixe, take this!
Ramza: Brother! That's Brother Zalbag's voice!
Delita: Something isn't right. I don't recall seeing Sixe overtake us on our way here.
Ramza: It doesn't matter. Our brother needs help!
Delita: Right, let's go! (They rush downstairs.)

~Hall of Ft. Zeakden
Zalbag: You won't get away with this, Sixe!
Sixe: Time isn't yours to spend, Zalbag. You and your army...(OOC: Of course, this is an imposter.)
Ramza: Brother!
Zalbag: Ramza, leave me to deal with this monster...you must go down to the basement! They're planning to blow us all up!
Delita: Sir Zalbag, that man...he isn't...
Zalbag: Go! (As Zalbag speaks, Sixe tries to make use of his distraction to attack, forcing Zalbag to parry.) That's an order!


Mission 9 (is a linked mission, so whatever damage from the first fight is carried over into this one):

~Basement of Ft. Zeakden
A harsh female voice: Hurry up! THey'll be here any minute! (OOC: This is Anabelle.)
Male voice: Ma'am, we've been doing this all day. It's not like we can work any...oww!
Female voice: No excuses! Keep it up!
Ramza: Stop! You don't have to kill yourselves! Just surrender and we'll spare you!
Female voice: Speak of the devil...they're already here. How much left?
Male voice: Just one more in the back.
Female voice: Get moving. I'll stop them here!

Ramza Turn 1:
