Zalbag: You are to deliver this letter to the Magistrate of Dorter under the command of Captain Zareb (the original brigade commander who Anabelle double crosses at Gariland).
Ramza: Is this all?
Zalbag: Not quite. The Death Corps, headless as it is, haven't entirely surrendered all their hideouts.
Ramza: If it's so helpless, why not let it rout itself?
Zalbag: Some hearts do not bend so easily; they can only be broken by cold steel.
Ramza: And others may defy fate. Sometimes I wonder if you know more than you let on...
Zalbag: I tell my men what needs to be known; you should know this, Ramza. Do you think I'm not giving enough information?
Ramza: Brother Zalbag, mayhap you are the one not informed. I fought a Death Corps squad as they retreated from Gariland. I killed one of their commanders. The rest of their men have fled to Dorter. Sixe may yet be alive among them.
Zalbag: And why would they not retreat? Their leader was dead; surely they were in disarray as a result. There's nothing to see here.
Ramza: I am not so sure...they seemed...too organized. As if...this was planned.
Zalbag: (standing up) Ramza, the Death Corps is dying. Retreat or withdrawl is secondary - this is the time to strike!
Ramza: As you wish, Brother. (Enter Zareb and Anabelle)
Zalbag: Just in time. This is Captain Zareb, a hero of the Battle of Limberry. And this, is Lieutenant Anabelle, the lady who finished Sixe for us.
Zareb: You must be the youngest Belouve. I hope you are as good a fighter as the chief here.
Zalbag: I'll personally vouch for the boy, Zareb. Remember, he did save the Marquis some time back. We'd best give him at least as much credit as Algus.
Zareb: Good (nods).
Anabelle: I am Anabelle du Ralzin. A pleasure to meet you. (She curtsies)
Ramza: Good to meet you both. I trust we'll begin our assault on the skeleton that is the Death Corps now?
Zareb: That's the spirit. We leave at dusk.
Ramza: As you will, Captain. (three exit, Ramza exits last, taking a quick glance back at Zalbag)

~Mandalia

Zareb: According to the map, the nearest rebel village is just up ahead. Ramza, I want you to wait in the back until I give the signal. (Ramza nods, and stops while Anabelle and Zareb continue onwards.)

Map changes to that a of a small viallage with Anabelle and Zareb

Zareb: Let me do the talking, subcommander.
Anabelle (looks away): As you wish.
Zareb: When the time is right, you're to run back and get the boy to strike.
Anabelle: Yes, sir. (The two walk into town.)
Zareb: It is I, Captain Zareb of the Hokuten 3rd Guards. I am looking for an Elder Raven of this town.
Man 1: What buisness have you with the Elder?
Zareb: Just a few questions. We suspect there is contraband in this village, but if we are mistaken, no one will be hurt.
Elder: (walking out) We have nothing to hide from the Hokuten. (Man 1 steps back and walks off.) What are you looking for, Captain?
Zareb: Two weeks ago, we received word that your village has stockpiled a large amount of arms for the Death Corps. You are to relinquish your armory to us.
Elder: If we give up the few weapons we have, what will we defend ourselves with? Sticks?
Zareb: So you admit to your crimes.
Elder: It's no crime to have weapons to fend off bandits, Captain. This handful of swords and helms...
Zareb: If you surrender now, you may escape with your life. Rebellion is a hanging offense, you know.
Anabelle: You can't be serious!
Zareb: Don't question me! Don't you forget...
Anabelle: If I may be so bold, captain, he may just be a patsy for the Death Corps. They loved to force their will on everyone.
Elder: I've merely stated my concerns, Captain. I've never stood in the way of your search.
Zareb: Then take me there, and quickly!

~Armory

Zareb: What is the meaning of this, Elder Raven?
Elder: As I said, Captain, we've precious little weaponry. What little we have is with our patrol as we speak.
Zareb: You damned liar! You take us for a fool?!
Zareb seizes the Elder
Zareb: This is your last chance. Where did you hide the weapons?
Elder: You don't trust your eyes, Captain? If you'd like, we could forge some new weapons for you to take, if you'd only lend us the iron
Zareb: You want your iron? (Withdraws sword.)  Come and get it!!! (Slays the man)
Anabelle gasps
Zareb: Get the boy, we're going to torch this place!
Man 1: (offscreen) They've slain the elder! Men, to arms!

~ Battle Banter

Man 1: You Hokuten are mad! What use is this bloodlust?
Zareb: We do nothing that needn't be done. You can't expect to hoard weapons under our nose and get away with it. It matters not if you're allied with us, the Nanten, or the Death Corps.
Man 2: Beasts are all you are, here to kill and destroy! Die!!
Ramza: We're only doing our job, I don't see...
Zareb: Don't try to reason with them, Ramza, it's not worth it. My dog thinks better than this lot.
Anabelle: ...Keep your cool, commander. Our enemies may just kill us if we are too careless.
Zareb: What? Can't I have some fun?

End Battle
(Background is abnormally red to reflect the torching of the town mixed with the setting sun.)
Man 1: May God damn you all! You Hokuten aren't human...
Zareb: Inhuman? No, this is mercy. I am merely preparing you for your future life in Hell.
Zareb: Ramza, do us the honor.
RAmza: I...excuse me, sir, I do not understand...
Zareb: He's the last of his kind. Finish him!
Ramza: Sir, I...
Anabelle: If I may, commander....(withdraws her claymore). May you find peace. (Anabelle kills him)

~That Evening, at camp

Ramza @ campfire

Anabelle: (enters, muttering to herself) Damnit, I'm getting too old for this...(OOC: I prefer this line over yours to give a subtle hint that Anabelle tried seducing Zareb and failed)
Ramza: ...(Glares at her)
Anabelle: Oh...it's nothing concerning you, boy...(eats her ration and sees Ramza not eating)...something on your mind? (OOC: This seems like a natural conversation opener, but this is meant to show that Anabelle is so removed from innocence she doesn't see why Ramza would find her execution troubling. Of course, she'll cover up well in the subsequent lines.)
Ramza: What happened this afternoon? Why did that have to happen?
Anabelle: Surely you've noticed it, Ramza. Men like Zareb are rising in ranks, and we lowly subordinates have to commit such...atrocities. I'm sorry you had to witness that...
Ramza: This isn't right. My father would have never allowed men like this to rise!
Anabelle: Sir Balbanes is no longer alive. This is no longer his era.
Ramza: True. This is my era. My time to strive towards the title of Heavenly Knight...
Anabelle: And what better way than to cut your own path, Ramza? Surely a Beolvue like you has the skill and talent to do so.
Ramza: I'd like to believe that, but...
Anabelle: But?
Ramza: I've never heard of my father going through anything like this. Did he have a warmonger for a commander and a Death Corps traitor for a best friend?
Anabelle: I understand - I've my own grudge with the Corps.
Ramza: That's what worries me, Anabelle. What if I have to fight Delita?
(pause)
Anabelle: Don't worry about it, Ramza. I'm sure your old friend will be fine, and I doubt we'll be locking blades with him anytime soon.
Ramza: How can you be so sure?
Anabelle: Call it...a woman's intuition...

~Gariland

Zareb: So this is the Corex Weapons Guild?
Anabelle: That's what all the locals say, sir. For a weapons guild, the defense is sparse. Death Corps have been undermanned since Sixe's death. (OOC: The implication here is that Anabelle did the scouting.)
Zareb: Perfect. Another easy victory..
Anabelle: I'm not so sure, sir. Something's still bothering me. A place like this looks too...respectable for a bandits' nest.
Zareb: It's hardly surprising. Merchants are just refined scum; they'll do anything for coin, even if they have to hang on the traitor's noose.
Ramza: So we're not going to burn...
Zareb: Nah. Just roll a few heads.
(OOC: This scene may seem trivial, but it's mostly to establish what happens next.)

~Corex Compound
Zareb: I am Captain Zareb of the Hokuten Third Guards. I am here for the arrest of Guildmaster Elric for treason.
Anabelle: Lay down your weapons or we will not spare your life!
Apprentice 1 (pointing at Anabelle): You're the bitch who...(glance from Anabelle)...! How dare you even show your face around here!
Apprentice 2: We won't disappoint him...(glance from Anabelle)...his memory lives with us all!
Apprentice 3: ...
Zareb: You fools have challenged the wrong man. Die!!!

Anabelle's First Turn
Anabelle: Commander, there isn't anything here.
Zareb: What do you mean?
Anabelle: I see mounds of coal stacked against the wall, but what kind of armory has no forge? It's almost as if they knew of our approach and moved everything out.
Zareb: Ridiculous. They couldn't move an entire shop on such short notice.
Anabelle: Sir, what if I'm right? Are you going to chase the next diversion sent your way?
Zareb: Quit nagging me, woman. Unlike you, I'm not afraid of peasants hiding in the dark.
Anabelle: Unlike you, Ramza and I have an actual mission to accomplish. Or did you forget about that letter?
Zareb: Stand your ground, that's an order!

Ramza's First Turn
Ramza: Sixe is dead. Why do you all still worship him?
Apprentice 1: Sixe is still very much alive...in our hearts, he's the only bright spot in our lives.
Apprentice 2: Brother Choto is right. I will never forget the day he threw out the old guildmaster. It was the first day we were finally free from the whims of his whip.
Apprentice 1: Since then, we've seen our weapons free an entire province. In exchange for weapons, we receive food, enough to never worry about starving again. I'll never let you set us back!
Ramza: It's all a lie! He treated you well because he's using you to seize power. He tried to trick me to do the same thing! Do you seriously think he'll keep his promises once he has the throne?
Apprentice 2: When you nobles are gone, we'll finally be free. He promised us that and I'd rather die than see anything else!
Zareb: See what I mean, Ramza? These idolators cannot be reasoned with. Only the sword can cure them.

Death Quotes:
Apprentice 3: How...I thought she...
Apprentice 2: Commander Sixe, the rest is up to you...
Apprentice 1: In death, we shall have the last laugh...
(OOC: In other words, Anabelle only told the first two apprentices and the Foreman of her plan, but all the people of the guild are familiar with her. This is why Apprentice 3 is confused.)

After Battle:
Ramza: This is a waste of time. The Guildmaster still hasn't shown himself. (OOC: Ramza in vanilla would not have said something about the "waste of life". This is meant to show dehumanization as well as tacitly supporting Anabelle.)
Zareb: Probably holed up in a room somewhere like the coward that he is. Split up and scour every room!
Anabelle: Yes, sir! Ramza, let's... 
Zareb: The boy goes with me, Lieutenant. You take the others.
Anabelle: As you will, sir. (Marches off with the two units Ramza deployed)
Zareb: Let's go, Ramza. He can't be far from here!

~In an undisclosed room:
Ramza: Are you the Guildmaster?
??? (holding a torch while leaning against the wall): You Hokuten are much too guillible. The Guildmaster is away on business.
Zareb: Damnit! Where is he?
???: You'll die before you learn that! (Dips the torch into a wooden barrel, igniting everything.)
Zareb: You motherfucker! (Stabs the guild foreman. As he does...the flames spread to the door, sealing their exit.)
Ramza: Captain, we must go! (Zareb tries to touch the doorknob but his hand recoils from the heat.)
Zareb: Argh...(A squire smashes down the door with an axe. Anabelle nods at the squire and then rushes through the flames to grab Ramza.)
Zareb: No...don't...(screen blacks out)

~Public Fountain (with Anabelle and Ramza in it):
Ramza: Hot...so hot...(opens his eyes). Where am I? And why am I wet?
Anabelle: You're alive.
Ramza: What...do you mean?
Anabelle: The Guildhall exploded. All the mounds of coal and barrels of oil wasn't for the forge, it was for us.
Ramza: ...Captain! Is he...
Anabelle: The Captain and you walked into a trap. His body is now nothing but ash.
Ramza: Then...it was you? You carried me out of there? (Anabelle nods.) Is everyone else...
Anabelle: No worse than minor burns.
Ramza: Thank Ajora...(a breeze blows across the sky)...You were right. They tricked us. How did you know?
Anabelle: Experience.
Ramza: What?
Anabelle: I was captured by the Death Corps in Dorter. They tricked my squad into striking at air while they outflanked me. I lost nearly everyone.
Ramza: That memory doesn't fade, does it? Just like Delita...
Anabelle: The dead live only in our past. They are merely figments of memory. Right now, we have a score to settle.
Ramza (stands up): Let's go...oww! (Ramza cringes at the sudden cold, mixed with fiery pain in areas no longer shielded by water.)
Anabelle (stands up): Your burns are more serious than the others. Let me carry you.
Ramza: Are you sure you can? You were burned just as badly as me.
Anabelle: I've survived worse. (She staggers trying to grab onto Ramza as she now feels the same pain. The two lock shoulders and awkwardly leave the water.)
(OOC: The basis of physical and emotional attraction...more to come)

~While Crossing Araguay Woods:
Some scene involving either Corsa talking with Delita, Slim, and some villagers about counterintel or Algus pleading for his life after being captured.

~Dorter City Slums (Morning):
Annabelle: Before I go, Ramza, I have an important task for you.
Ramza: Yes, ma'am?
Annabelle (laughs): No need, Ramza. It's just Annabelle. Anyways, I want you to wear this (shoves an outfit into Ramza's hands).
Ramza: What is this?
Annabelle: You cannot be seen as a noble. Go to the intersection of Field and Camp and see if the Martel Group is still in existance.
Ramza: Is that it?
Annabelle: No, if they're still here, try to find out if their leader will be in town tonight. Be careful not to stick out.
Ramza: Why are we doing this? If they're criminals, why not just arrest them like Captain Zareb would have us do?
Annabelle: Do you trust me, Ramza?
Ramza: Of course, you saved my life.
Annabelle: Now it's your turn to save mine. Let's meet again after lunch.

~Dorter City Slums (Afternoon):
(Ramza and Anabelle walking, an old man following)
Annabelle: How was it?
Ramza: They still exist. Their boss, I think, is called Durbs?
Annabelle: That's right...will they meet tonight?
Ramza: I...couldn't figure that out. He's in town, though.
Annabelle: That's good enough. Let's go there tonight!
Ramza: Why did you have me do this?
Annabelle: The Martel Group sold me out to the Death Corps 5 years ago, Ramza. Their leader is a stooge who pretends to be an independent mercenary guild so they can murder, kidnap, and spy on important men.
Ramza: Wouldn't the Magistrate do something about this?
Annabelle: I fear he has already been blackmailed. You should have seen the shock on his face when he read that letter from Lord Dycedarg asking him to exterminate the Death Corps in Dorter. He doesn't understand how serious this is.
Ramza: What do you mean?
Annabelle (glances over her shoulder, eyeing the old man): Their revolution isn't going as planned. Sixe tried taking command himself and I killed him. By now, they're getting desperate. They'll do anything to kill their enemies, no matter how crazy or how many innocents have to die. You saw what they did to Captain Zareb. I won't let you become their next victim.
Ramza: So we're going to do his job for him?
Annabelle (in a raised voice): Exactly! We're going to destroy the Martel Group for being a Death Corps puppet! Without it, their influence here will fade! (Old Man interjects and scurries off.) Damn, we've been overheard! Let's go, now!
Ramza: I'm not sure about all this. Acting on your vendetta wasn't part our mission.
Annabelle: Justice isn't for just us, Ramza. Think about what happened to Captain Zareb. Do you want that happening again?
Ramza: No...no, I won't let it! Let's go.
