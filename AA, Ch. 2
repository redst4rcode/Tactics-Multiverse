"They're gone.

Delita, my best friend, shot by someone who I thought was a friend in need. Even my last good memory of him is growing faint and cold.

Zalbag, the brother I admired and cherished so much, utterly destroyed by treachery. Zalbag believed in me in a way Dycedarg never could.

Amidst it all, I did the only thing I could do: I dropped it all and ran away with Alma and Teta. We three spent many months comforting each other in Orbonne Monestary, still shivering from that bloody winter day. And through our comfort, we gained a tight bond.

When I could finally look myself in the mirror again, I did the first thing that any good Ajoran would do."

~Orbonne Monestary - Library
Ramza: Father, forgive me for what I have done. It has been 3 months since my last confession.
Simon: Speak your sins unto me, child.
Ramza: Through my decisions and inactions, my brother and best friend are dead. I come to you not as a Beolvue, Father, but as a man. How can I redeem myself for their loss?
Simon: You are not wholly to blame, my son. You did not light the fuse, nor pull the trigger.
Ramza: ...
Simon: Ramza...have you ever considered joining me in this monestary? Alma has been in better spirits since your arrival here three months ago, and I'm sure Teta would not have been able to deal with the loss of her brother without your presence.
Ramza: I am a knight...no, a fallen squire...all I wanted was to do good in the world. To do my father proud. He always looked at me as if I could do something that my lord brothers could not.
Simon: Balbanes was a great man, Ramza - he did great things, there's no denying that. You could do great things as a man of the cloth, I assure you. Zalbag would want you to care for Alma, as Delita would want you to care for Teta.
Ramza: Simon...
Simon: Welcome home, Ramza.

~Orbonne Monestary - Chapel
Teta: Sitting by the window again, Ramza? You've been like this every day for the last month.
Ramza: ...
Teta: Alma's spending a week with Lord Dycedarg, the least you could do is afford me some company...
Ramza: I...it's nothing.
Teta: I understand, Ramza. I lost my brother as well, remember? Would you like to talk about it?
Ramza: It's...not that. I just, don't want to waste away here doing nothing! Look at those three, they're so...active! And I'm...
Teta: Perhaps you should join them? I'm sure that pairing up would be more interesting than standing aside, watching
Ramza: Pairing up...what of you, Teta? What about that "friend" of yours? Is that not what he wants? (OOC: Ramza's talking about Slim)
Teta: What? no! I don't have a sword arm...I barely have a ladle arm!
Ramza: I just worry...what if he's Death Corps? I don't know about you, but I have a feeling Sixe is still out there. I don't want you getting hurt again...What's his name again?
Teta: Slim, and I doubt he is. He doesn't seem the type, really - more a romantic than a fighter. We've had a few long talks about a woman he loves. (OOC: We need to change the Corsa scene with Teta so the code word for Teta's release is Corsa's name, rather than Slim's, because Teta is not supposed to know Slim is a member of the Death Corps.)(@@@)
Ramza: That name sounds familiar...just I forget where...

~Orbonne Monestary
Teta: Milady Agrias, a word, please?
Agrias: Of course.
[whispers]
Agrias: If this is your idea of a joke, Teta, you have a foul sense of humour.
Ramza: What's wrong, Agrias?
Agrias: Teta claims that there's an attempt to be made on the Princess' life.
Ovelia: Someone wants to...
Agrias: Milady, it's nothing but rubbish. You needn't worried.
Ovelia: But I do, Agrias - what if it isn't?
Kiech: No worries, your majesty! I'm sure no one would be stupid enough to take me and Charlie head on! I mean...the nerve...[Charlie forces Kiech to sit back down]
Charlie: I don't see any pressing concerns, but shouldn't it be investigated anyways, Agrias? For her majesty's safety?
Agrias: I have no duty investigating the Crown. My vows are to the Princess.
Charlie: If it behooves you as a knight to investigate these petty matters, then perhaps your ladies in waiting can have the honor?
Agrias: Why you patronizing....
Charlie: Hey, I'm just tellin' it straight. I'm no knight, but a mercenary of my reputation can't be stuck doing stakeouts. I'm sure you'd feel the same.
Agrias: Enough, I will investigate this matter myself. Lavian, Alicia! you two will guard the princess in my absence. Teta, you will accompany me to the source of this rumor.
Ramza: If it's all right with you, Agrias, I'd like to come along. I would like to make sure Teta remains safe as well.
Agrias: ... (OOC: Agrias is upset here, as it seems both Charlie and Ramza are questioning her abilities)
Ramza: It's what Delita would have wanted.
Agrias: ...As you wish.

[12:22] <fdc> for thematic reasons...this is right when the DC upsurge is going
[12:22] <fdc> Sixe just got news that Fovoham's units defeated the last of the Hokuten
[12:22] <fdc> so he orders his units into full action

Battle VS DC and Mercs. Ramza+co caught in middle
There may be usual taunts, but we may need to foreshadow Sixe's return here.

~Dorter Slums
Slim: Teta! what are you doing here? The whole city is in uproar; you should be somewhere safe.
Teta: Well, Slim, I...
Agrias: This is him? This is your informant?
Slim: You didn't bring her with you? (OOC: Slim was suggesting Ramza and Teta slip out of the Monestary with Ovelia alone.) Was my word not good enough?
Agrias: I wanted to check her sources for myself.
Slim: You fools! Go back now; Ovelia's in grave danger!
Agrias: That's Princess Ovelia to you, cur!
Slim: Fine. Her royal highness, Princess Ovelia whatever her last name is, is gonna die if you don't get your asses back to her side right now! [Looks around] Sorry Teta, I really don't have the time to chat. I have an errand to run.[leaves]
Ramza: Well, can we trust him?
Teta: I wouldn't lie to you, Ramza, no more than I would to Delita.
Agrias: Something's just not right. This whole city is ablaze with something sinister; we shouldn't be here.

~Orbonne Monestary
Agrias: Holy Ajora...what happened here? Lavian! Alicia! Report!
Kiech: They're dead...[party turns around, camera pans to a wounded Kiech]
Agrias: What?!
Kiech: She was kidnapped...we were...uh...overpowered while you were gone...
Ramza: Who did this? [Teta moves to bandage Kiech]
Kiech: I don't fucking know! I think it was...uh...the Death Corps? I was too busy fighting to notice too much...but I'm pretty sure he said it was them. I can still fight...we should go after them; let's destroy them for what they've done...
Ramza: First my brother and now this? Sixe...you've pulled one too many schemes!
Agrias: Are you certain? Ramza, we wouldn't want to be chasing ghosts. They have no power now.
Teta: These wounds are very minor... (OOC: technically foreshadowing, but Teta draws attention to herself for the next line)
Agrias: Teta, your source predicted our attack - surely he knows more. Perhaps a group of local thugs did this?
Teta: I guess...(OOC: Teta doesn't want to believe the Hokuten or the Death Corps did, but she's too shocked to say much)

~Dorter Slums, after a battle.

Ramza: Sixe? You're alive? Return the princess at once!
Sixe: I have no idea what you're talking about. I was told the Princess was kidnapped yesterday by mercenaries hired by the Hokuten.
Agrias: We've learned from one of our men that it was you Death Corps who kidnapped the Princess. I'd trust my men over yours.
Sixe (laughs): Then why isn't he beside you now? Is he truly "your" man?
Ramza: He...should have shown up by now...
Agrias: So, he's with you then! Return the Princess at once!
Sixe: It seems a ghost like me should not talk amongst the living. I'll let a more familiar face take it from here...[turns from Ramza and company]
Ramza: Wait! Sixe, you'll pay for what you did to Zalbag!
Sixe [with his back to them]: Slim, come out. Maybe you can explain it better.
Teta: !
Agrias: It seems your source may not have been so reliable after all, Teta.
Teta: No...knowing this...I somehow trust them a bit more...
Slim: Sorry it had to be this way, Teta, but I couldn't let you know too early. I was worried for you, and was watching from the roofs. That Kiech fellow gave you all the slip and is on his way to the docks right now. Him and the fat guy were sent last month to Orbonne by the Hokuten to kill the Princess.
Teta: I'm...sorry for ever doubting you, Slim. [Sixe begins to leave]
Ramza: Get BACK here Sixe, I'm not done with you! [moves forward]
Sixe [turns around and puts his hand to his sword]: Yes?
Ramza: Zalbag's death is on your hands...and you're just going to walk away from me?
Sixe: For that, I can only take some of the credit. Was it not you who fought against your own ranks at Zeakden?
Ramza: You bastard! [readies his sword and lunges at Sixe, but grabbed by Slim.]
Teta: Slim, don't hurt him!
Agrias: I have no time for your foolishness, Ramza. I must save the Princess, or have you forgotten our mission? [Leaves]
Ramza: My brother will be avenged, Sixe. Mark my words, your blood WILL be on my blade...
Sixe: As a cadet, you are a pawn and being used is your fate. Six months ago, I captured you from the Hokuten and used you for my own purposes. (OOC: Shogi metaphor.) I deceived you, but if you had followed along, I would have freed you of fate. But you ran away from it all! For what? Your brother? Even as a Hokuten general, is he still not a servant of the Crown? All the while, he uses pawns like you to break free men like me. He had no regrets in following such a dark duty; why should I have remorse in sealing his fate?
Ramza: You monster! Not only did you use me, you'd gloat to my face? Ajora damn you!!!
Teta: Ramza, please, get a hold of yourself. Think of Delita, would he want this? Would Zalbag?

Ramza makes a choice here:

>Back Off
Ramza [drops his sword]: I'm not surrendering because of you, Sixe. I'm doing it for Teta. (Slim lets Ramza go)
Sixe: As a sign of goodwill, I'll give you some troops to work with. A troubled soul like you shouldn't fight alone.
Ramza: ...[Ramza and Teta turn to leave]

>Yell
Ramza: Unhand me, you peasant dog! [Slim puts his knife to Ramza's throat]

Teta: NO!!!!

Ramza: Sixe, you coward! Too scared to kill me yourself?!

Slim: What would Teta think if I killed you? Do you want her to cry?

Ramza: I...[drops his sword as Slim lets Ramza go; Ramza and Teta turn to leave]

[2 routes merge at this point]

Sixe: Go after them, Slim.

Slim: Why? The Princess doesn't matter to us. (OOC: This means that Sixe does not realize Dyce plans to defame him with Ovelia's death, he's just simply use what he knows about Ovelia to add Ramza and Teta to his cause. We need to make him less of a MarySue. Feel free to change this sentence if too vague, but make sure it's not too long since this is common knowledge between Sixe and Slim.) Besides, he's more of a brat than me!
(Myrm: Changed from "pawn" to "unimportant". Pawn gives too much to the player, but unimportant implies that she could be unimportant to their plans, rather than unimportant in general.)

Sixe: That's not your job. Spread the revolution to Gariland. Make sure the Hokuten know I'm back from the dead.

Slim: But your disguise...

Sixe: ...is no longer necessary. We have the Hokuten running scared. This will be the final blow!

[Slim exits after Ramza]

~Thieves' Hideout
[Cutscene starts as the party enters Sweegy Woods]

Charlie: About time you got here.
Kiech: Yeah yeah, you try escaping from those bastards with a busted arm.
Charlie: It was just a scratch, Kiech, I made sure of it. Enough to make you lose enough blood to look serious, but not enough to do any lasting harm. At most, you might have gotten lightheaded waiting for that cute cleric to show up.
Kiech: It still hurt like hell.
Charlie: Perhaps, then, you'd rather have attacked the knights head on and risked getting killed, instead of drugging them and the girl?
Kiech: ...
Charlie: 's what I thought. Anyways, you brought food, right? I'm a horrible fisherman, and I spent all day hungry.
Kiech: Yeah, I figured you'd be running low. How's the girl?
Charlie: She's got enough to keep moving at a steady pace, but no more. She's asleep right now.
Kiech: Least we don't have to listen to her whine.
Charlie: True that. Let's make our way to the Academy - we have a bounty to collect. You're carrying her this time - unless your armbones didn't mend properly.
Kiech: I'll carry the damned girl...
Charlie: Damned straight. Hell, Kiech, I get worse cuts shaving than what I gave you...

~Gariland Magic City

Agrias: I can't believe I let myself rely on such a fool. Ramza isn't half what his father was, and damned if I'm going to let the Death Corps do my job! (in Vanilla, she had no knowledge that Ramza was a Beolvue, but here he's spent much time with Alma - a known Beolvue, and Ovelia's only friend. Agrias would have to be blind to not put 2+2 together here.)

Agrias: Lavian! Alicia! You two...*sigh*...

[Agrias spots someone who looks like Charlie walk around a corner, and gives chase]

End Sweegy cutscenes.

~ Gariland Magic City

Slim: OK, I'm gonna do a bit of quick recon, you guys stay here, and I'll...
Ramza: You take me for a fool, Slim? Kiech also went to do some quick recon. We're coming along.
Slim: Fine...
[small walk to HQ, and guards are in front]
Slim: Crap, I can't get in.
Teta: [walks to the guards] Excuse me...
[One guard walks towards Teta, leaving an opening. Slim moves around quickly, and ducks inside. Cue generic chatting animation between guards and Teta]
Ramza: (aside. possibly a thought bubble) How have we not come across Agrias yet? We didn't leave too far after her...whatever, that ingrate's probably lost in the woods somewhere, good riddance.
[Slim slips back out to Ramza's iding spot. Teta disengages the soldiers, and walks back to the group]
Slim: She's at the Academy - taken there by a pair of mercenaries.
Ramza: Good - now let's go [Starts to walk off. Teta follows, but Slim turns away] Slim! Don't you forget; you're here to follow MY orders.
Slim: Sorry, Ramza, I tagged along to find the Princess. I'm the best at finding stuff out, but I'm no fighter. I've followed my orders and done my share.
Teta: Slim, please...[takes a step towards him] I'd...really like it if you would stay with me...
Slim: I'm...sorry, Teta, I can't. I have other business to do. [Leaves]
Ramza: Really, Teta?
Teta: [turns around] ...?
Ramza: He's the enemy, Teta. I can't have you falling for everyone we come across that's nice to you. He's a spy, for Ajora's sake - you could get us killed! What would Delita think?
Teta: *sobbing*
Ramza: OK, I'm sorry, let's go...
Teta: Ramza y...you...idiot! [runs off]
Ramza: Teta, wait...*sigh*...fine, I'll save Ovelia myself...

~Gariland Academy

[if Ramza recieved a party from Sixe]

M.Squire: Well, look who we have here. You're a sight for sore eyes, Ramza!
Ramza: I remmeber you...you were in my squad, right? Back when I was Hokuten?
F.Chemist: Yeah, I remember those days well...
M.Squire: Days long since past, old friend. I hope you won't take this personally, but capturing a Death Corps commander is big. Lord Dycedarg will be very pleased if we kill one.
Ramza: Wasn't it protocol to capture traitors alive for interrogation?
M. Squire: I'm sure Lord Dycedarg would understand that it's not always possible.

(Ramza turn 1)
Ramza: A shame, really - you all were my friends back then. 
M. Squire: No hard feelings - we're just doing our job.
Ramza: And I'm doing what's right. You see the difference, I'm sure.
M. Squire: So is that why you're now rolling around with these pigs? Spare me the sermon, Ramza, I don't need to hear it!

(Ramza turn 3)
Ramza: No quarter for an old friend?
M. Squire: You betrayed us, Ramza - what did you expect us to do? Open our arms and embrace you so you can stab us in the back again?
Ramza: what happened to "no hard feelings?"
M. Squire: We're sorry it had to come to this, Ramza. You understand our responsibilities, but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy them.

(after battle)
(Myrm this scene is strange, and I may need to rework/omit it. I'm thinking I may put it after the Teta argument, because he's in the poor side of town anyways. After all - the timeline isn't too screwy if he sees them dead first and has to rush in - the same amount of time has passed. There's really no way for the squire to tell Ramza subtly without just mumbling it to himself loudly, or something of the like)
(OOC: I'm not sure I see exactly why this scene is so strange, but try one with both variants and I'll see which one I like better.)
(Myrm: It's strange because it seems a little out of place to me. Current storyline work has this happening as Ramza's rushing into the castle, past the (now defunct) guards. Why would he be mentioning this to someone so close, it ruins the illusion)

~Inside the school

Squire: *Whistling* [tossing bodies onto a wagon. Agrias, Keich, Charlie]
[Ramza walks by squire]
Squire: [glances back, making sure Ramza's passd, but not out of range] 's a damn shame DC killed these guys
Ramza: [looking back] Death Corps?
Squire: Yeah - came in and slaughtered these poor saps...
Ramza: [walking to the bodies, notices Agrias] The Corps...killed Agrias? a Holy Knight?
Squire: like I know who anyone is - I...
Ramza: And what of the Princess? Surely you've seen Ovelia about - I know you squires see everything, even if you just keep your mouths shut about it...
Squire: sir, I...can't...breathe...
Ramza: [throwing squire down, waits for a moment. Squire seems to be unconsious.] Damn...knocked out... [Ramza kicks him testingly before rushing farther into the school] This day just keeps getting better and better...

[If Ramza didn't recieve a party from Sixe)

F. Chemist: Ramza! we missed you so much!
Ramza: I remember you all - my old squadmates!
M. Squire: You should have seen it - Princess Ovelia passed by here, and she didn't look too happy, either!
F. Chemist: Ramza, you always seemed to have a better idea of what was going on - that's what made you such a great leader.
Ramza: I...was?
F. Chemist: Better than our current one! Please, will you lead us again?
Ramza: But I'm a traitor - you all will be...
M. Squire: Our loyalties lie with you, Ramza.
Ramza: ...thank you...all...
M. Squire: Quickly, the Princess is inside. You can brief us later!

~Inside Garliand Academy

Agrias: Princess!
Ovelia: Agrias!
Headmaster: Guards!
[2 knights rush in]
Agrias: Unhand her at once!
Headmaster: I'm sorry, but I have no choice.
Agrias: And why do you HAVE to do it?
Headmaster: Orders from above, dear. You understand, I'm sure.
[guards drag Agrias towards Hall 1 - foreshadowing that you need to get there to recruit her]

~Same as above

Ramza: Damn! Spotted!
(Victory condition - fight or flee!)

[If Ramza defeats all foes]
Dying Knight: I...I remember you...
Ramza: Where is she?
Dying Knight: Who?
Ramza: The princess, who else?
Dying Knight: Igros...
Ramza: I hope your last breath holds true...


[If Ramza escapes down Hall 1]
Ramza: I know that voice...Agrias?

~Prison Cell 1

Agrias: Ramza! They've taken her!
Ramza: I know, that's why I'm here. [walking to cell door, fiddles with it] Any idea..
Agrias: Igros. I heard the headmaster mention it, it must be where she's been taken!
Ramza: [stoping for a moment] the Headmaster's in on this?
Agrias: Focus, Ramza! The Princess is in danger!
Ramza: Right, right... [door opens] I just figured I might be able to sway him...guess not...
[pair leave]

[If Ramza escapes down Hall 2]
Ramza: I know those voices...

~Prison Cell 2

Ramza: Somehow, I knew it would be you, bastard!
Charlie: They killed him! That boy was like a son to me....(Charlie punches a desk, toppling it.)
Ramza (just noticing Kiech's corpse): He damn well deserved it! You two are just bandits.
Charlie: I'm no outlaw. I'm a mercenary hired by that damned backstabber Dycedarg.
Ramza: You mean...my brother...(OOC: Do we want to assume Charlie knows Ramza is a Belouve? I don't think Charlie would be observant as Agrias, or is it self-evident common knowledge to everyone in the monestary?)
Charlie: Ordered us to kidnap the Princess, kill all her guards, and blame the deaths on the Death Corps.
Ramza: But why would my brother...wish the princess ill?
Charlie: Your brother has power as Prince Larg's advisor. Prince Larg has power because of the favor of his sister, the Queen. She can only keep power if the royal brat becomes King. Don't see now? Ovelia is in the way and so am I, for knowing too much.
Ramza: Where is she now?
Charlie: Where else? She's going to be Igros, to her slaughter.
Ramza (raises his fist): I...will not allow anyone to harm her.
Charlie: Then take me with you. I may not care about royalty, but no one makes a fool of me!

[3 options remerge at this point]

(Myrm: At this point, in the interest of not writing 50 diverging scripts, I'm writing Agrias/Charlie/Keich out of the storyline. I may add in some mid-battle lines, like Agrias during the hanging battle in Vanilla, but I'm going to try and keep everything as simple as possible otherwise)

Rofel: Ah, the youngest Belouve, if I recall correctly? I've heard great things of you from your brother.
Ramza: Who are you?
Rofel: An ally of your brother's - and you as well, should you wish it.
Ramza: You have my attention, good sir.
Ramza: What do you want?
Rofel: I want little more than what you want - I'm sure you're familar with the mastermind behind the deaths of both Lord Zalbag's death and a certain talented cadet of common birth?
Ramza: His very name makes my blood boil. I take it you are also his enemy?
Rofel: He is an enemy to all, and we would very much like to rectify his errors.
Ramza: And yet knights like you do not act. Why do you not attack his stronghold in Dorter?
Rofel: I am of the Church of Ajora, child. A knight of the cloth. You're doing well, and are on a very bright path.
Ramza: Why are you avoiding my questions?
Rofel: Worry not, my child, when our paths cross again, your wish will bear fruit. (Myrm: Rofel is being purposely evasive here. I honestly don't see him getting much in the way of personality in this sense, much like Celia and Lede lacked any real personality - he is assumed to be an Ultima Demon like them, after all. I don't see him telling Ramza anything he wouldn't be authorized to tell.)
[Rofel leaves]
Ramza: Wait...come back! What was all that about?

~Igros Castle Gates

Guard 1: Away with you, we've no time for your ilk.
Ramza: What are you saying? I'm Ramza Belouve! Son of Heavenly Knight Balbanes! Younger brother to Prince Larg's confidant, Lord Dycedarg, and to the late Commander Zalbag!
Guard 1: And you're giving us nothing that a drunkard wouldn't know. Begone with you, impostor!
Ramza: Let me through, or by my word, I'll slay you where you stand...
Guard 1: The word of a commoner? Don't trifle with us, you lying cheat.
Guard 1 (aside to Guard 2): Sound the alarm [Guard 2 leaves]
Ramza: [walking off] I can't believe I'm a stranger in my own home...

~Outside the castle

Alma: [offscreen] You should know better, Brother Ramza...
Ramza: [looks around, sees Alma enter] Alma? How did you...
Alma: Don't worry about it - they won't notice me gone for a while to come. I heard of an impostor, and I knew it had to be you.
Ramza: What's going on? Is there someone pretending to be me?
Alma: Dycedarg's been keeping an eye on you since Zalbag died - he won't tell me why, though. Far as I know, you're the only you... (break in text, Alma turns around, looking wistfully away) ...I overheard him and Duke Larg mention "reminding you of where you belong", though.
Ramza: Where I belong?
Alma: I don't know what he means either, honestly. Dycedarg's always up to his neck in some plot or another, it seems. He's been much more careful since our brother died, though...and he seems somehow a little more...
(pause in text here for a few seconds, as if Alma is refusing to admit it to herself)
Ramza: As if our Lord Brother seems more what?
Alma: ...Where's Teta? I've not seen her in so long, and I've much to tell her! (OOC: Alma's purposefully changing the topic here. again, doesn't want to admit Dyce being more evil without Zalbaag to reign him in)
Ramza: [taken aback] Teta? She...ran off...
Alma [leans in like a furious mother scolding a child]: Took off? Ramza, you know Teta as well as I do. You know how she is, and how she's been since Delita left us...
Ramza: Yes, I know, but...
Alma: You know nothing, clearly! She's off somewhere, alone and scared, and you're here making a fool of yourself in front of those who cared for you!
Ramza: She ran away from me because some Death Corps streetear stole her heart.
Alma: And you didn't stop her? Ramza...I...
Ramza: Alma, you don't understand! I didn't have time! Dycedarg's kidnapped the princess, and he intends to kill her!
Alma: [after another pause]...I think Dycedarg's right...
Ramza: What?
Alma: You've forgotten where your loyalties lie. I don't care how much Dycedarg plots, he's not capable of that and you know it!
Ramza: But I...[this shouldn't interrupt Alma's text box or speech]
Alma: [continuing] You're making excuses...bad, horrible, unbelievable excuses...for abandoning Teta. You've forgotten who your family is! It's me, Dycedarg, and Teta, your adoptive sister! Or have you forgotten about her?
Ramza: No, but...
Alma: Delita was your brother, just like how Teta was my sister, Ramza! That means she should be your sister too, but you left her to the wolves! Leave me at once, Ramza, find her and bring her back to MY care - she's clearly not safe with YOU anymore!
[Ramza, looking sad and forlorn, walks off]

(allow for player to save here, if they choose. Done as Goug event w/Musty recruitment, so they can access the shop)

~Outside Igros Castle (Battle)

Ramza: I can't believe Alma...
Guard 2 (same man as before): That's him, the impostor!
Ramza: Well, glad to see my luck is as bad as ever...

[2 sets of knights. One is the patrol in question, and one is a pair of female knights laballed as "guests"/ Knight one has Rafa's skills and equip options, and Knight 2 has Corsa's. These knights are dressed as Hokuten.]

Knight 1 turn 1
Knight 1: He needs our help! Let's move!
Knight 2: Be careful. You can't afford another injury.

End battle.

Ramza: Traitors, I see? Perhaps I could see my brother if... (OOC: Ramza is plotting to turn them in to regain his brother's favour - a hint of the corruption to come, but it's quickly brushed aside)
Knight 1: Have you forgotten me, Ramza? (Knights cast off their disguises)
Ramza: Corsa? (slight pause, Ramza reaches for his sword) ...why are you here?
Corsa: To save your life, my friend. Ramza, you couldn't have fought them alone.
Ramza: Why did you help me? Are you saving me just so you and Sixe can use me again? (Ramza withdraws his sword.)
Unknown Knight: This was a mistake...
Corsa: Rafa, stand strong. He won't harm us, he's just angry. Let's go somewhere a little less likely to get us killed...

~ Bar scene.

[Rafa and Corsa already have a seat. Possibly having one shoo away the advances of a thief]

Ramza: [at counter] Ale please. (OOC: another hint of things to come. Vanilla players will expect milk here, and see another phase in his corruption)
[Pause while Ramza gets his drink, and seats himself with the pair]
Ramza: So, who's the girl? I don't recognise her from our misadventure a few months back...
Corsa: Her name is Rafa, a Khamja...
Rafa: [Interrupting] Ex-Khamja
Corsa:...An Ex-Khamja assassin. We're trying to save her brother.
Ramza: Hmph. I'm glad you're trying to save somebody's brother.
Rafa: This was a mistake...
Ramza: Is that all you can say?
Corsa: Rafa is worried sick because Malak is still a Khamja. Her brother's been assigned to pose as a Death Corps assassin to defame us.
Ramza: [Standing] Good, I'm glad that the peasants will finally be able to see you for the scum that you are.
Corsa: Ramza, he's going to do it by killing the Princess.
Ramza: [sits back down] He's got her?
Corsa (shakes her head): Tomorrow, the Princess is leaving for her coronation at Lesalia. Before she can even leave Igros, Malak will lead a squad to ambush her carriage and kill her.
Rafa: My brother believes that in doing this, we will both finally be free of Barinten. He's wholly devoted to his cause, and won't see the truth no matter how much I try to convince him.
Ramza: Which is?
Rafa: If he goes through with this, they'll kill him on the spot. Even if he gets away, no lord is going to protect him from the manhunt.
Ramza: And I'm assuming you Death Corps will shelter this villain instead?
Corsa: All Rafa wants to do is protect her brother. Can you turn your back this time?
Ramza: If I find out that this is another two-timing plot...
Rafa: Even if this is only a scheme by the Corps, I'd rather die than see my brother fall prey to Barinten's intrigue.
Corsa: You're...sure about this, Rafa? If we fail, both of you will die.
Rafa: That's a risk I'm willing to take. Malak is my only brother. I'm all he has left. (OOC: this line is meant to relate to Ramza and coerce him to submit. It may also make him feel incredibly guilty about Zalbag and, possibly Teta).

~Igros City Streets (Path to Belouve Manor...different than the previous map)
(~FDC: We need to add a few lines for Corsa as the blatant classism of the Headmaster would definitely provoke a response from her.)

Headmaster: Ramza Belouve, I remember you. You were a star pupil.
Ramza: [Turns around] Headmaster?
Headmaster: Glad to see your memory isn't as skewed as your loyalties - En Garde!

Headmaster Turn 1
Headmaster: Why do you oppose your family, Ramza? Why would you stand against all that I've taught you?
Ramza: Step aside, Headmaster. I shouldn't have to kill you.
Headmaster: A good child like you shouldn't surround himself with such filth. ARen't you ashamed of their unrighteousness?
Ramza: Righteousness? There is no righteous cause in this entire forsaken land, let alone in what you're doing.
Headmaster: Then why bother saving a Princess you don't even know?

Ramza Turn 1
Ramza: Aren't you afraid of the consequences, Headmaster? As knights, we're told to do bring honor to our families.
Headmaster: Not quite, my lad. As knights, our highest honor comes from upholding the law of the land. Order is what a knight must protect, lad, or everyone will fall into ruin. To let anything interfere with that knightly duty so sacred to Ajora is a sign of weakness fit for the savages beside you. Civilization isn't always easy, but without the necessary sacrifice, we'll be nothing more than barbarians.
Ramza: Murdering royalty is now legal? How are we any different than the Death Corps, then?
Headmaster: Where did you learn to utter such stupidities, child? Only a fool would mix light with darkness. The royal family has always kept the best interests of every subject at heart. They are worthy of our gratitude and sacrifice. The unlettered sops who call themselves the Death Corps care only for themselves; they'll loot the entire country to sate their own greed. To compare the...bitter taste of royal edicts to wanton destruction is insane.
Ramza: So the Princess is nothing but a unfortunate victim of fate? I'm sorry, sir, but my father taught me better than you ever did!
Headmaster: Dear boy, your father is dead. You cannot live in the shadow of his indiscretions. (OOC: Referring to allowing Delita to attend the Academy and possibly to the assumption that Ramza, like his father, fancies commoners like Corsa. This will be more apparent if we have a line where Corsa tries to rebut the headmaster and Ramza tells her not to interfere.)

End of Battle / if Agrias was deployed
Agrias: I too, am a servant of the Crown, but my loyalties are with the entire royal family. Why did you betray the Princess like this?
Headmaster: We do what we must, dear girl. My loyalties are different from yours - you follow Princess Ovelia, and I follow Lord Dycedarg - in the end, we're all merely pawns.
Ramza: If you know you're a pawn, why play the game?
Headmaster: Pawns becomes knights, rooks and queens, my boy! I was poised to promote!
Agrias: At the expense of an innocent?
Headmaster: All are innocent, and all are corrupt - it's merely a question of how much! (OOC: And thus, his hypocrisy is complete.)

After the above OR if Agrias not deployed
Ovelia: *Screaming*
Ramza: No...


~Beoulve Manor

[Nobles of all sorts running amok. Knights are running around, and Dycedarg can be seen among them. Malak leaps atop a building, which is quickly surrounded by Dyce and Knights]

Dycedarg: May as well jump, child - you're surrounded.
Rafa: Malak!
Malak: Rafa! Get back!
Dycedarg: [turning around] Leverage? Men! if you can't kill the boy, kill the girl instead!

Ramza Turn 1
Ramza: Lord Brother, why are you doing this?
Dycedarg: You don't see it, Ramza? Barinten's invasion on our land? Surely you don't believe that this boy, or that girl, are of Gallione?
Ramza: I'll not listen to any more of your lies!

Charlie Turn 1:
Charlie: You son of a bitch! Dycedarg, you won't escape my iron fists!
Dycedarg: Apparently, my mousetrap was too small to kill you both. No matter, you'll see him again soon in Hell.
Charlie: This is for Kiech! DIE!!!!

Dycedarg 50% HP
Dycedarg: Ugh, I'll need to rest. Finish them all; spare no one!
Hokuten Knight: Uhh...sir, what of your kid brother?
Dycedarg: Kill him too. Teach that traitor the meaning of justice!
Ramza: Dycedarg!
Dycedarg: You should visit, Ramza - should you survive, Alma would be so happy to see you... [teleports away]


Battle End
Ramza: This has gone on long enough...

~Igros City Streets (Scene where Corsa and Rafa met Ramza)

Ramza: [talking to his troops] To arms, we attack now!
Corsa: Stop this, Ramza!
Ramza: Corsa, I won't have you commanding my troops.
Corsa: Ramza, you know better than to run into a trap!
Ramza: And I know how to set one, too! So many troops here means the castle's sparsely defended. You're being too cautious, Corsa, and it'll be your downfall. [walks off]
Corsa: [grabbing Ramza] You're being a fool, Ramza...
Ramza: *sighs*
[slight pause as Ramza calms down, and Corsa lets go, followed by another short pause. wind blowing slightly to emphasize an awkward silence]
Ramza: What happened 6 months ago, Corsa?
Corsa: You mean at Zeakden?
Ramza: Yeah. You seemed to be on our side, you promised Delita not to interfere, and then...
[another small pause]
Corsa: I saw something in you, Ramza - something I hadn't seen outside the Death Corps in a while. That...sparkle in your eye...I can't really explain it any better...[takes a few steps away from Ramza]...I wanted you and Delita to join us.
Ramza: ...and we could all be Sixe's pawns together?
Corsa: *sighs* I...didn't forsee us being used like that, Ramza. I...should've known better...
Ramza: And now that you do, why do you keep allowing him to use you like that?
[Corsa holds out her left hand]
Ramza: That's...
Corsa: A wedding band, yes.
Ramza: Why that...[pause, unsheathes sword] I'll kill him. I'll slay that bastard where...
Corsa: And make me your enemy?
Ramza: [Sheathes sword] I...I'm sorry, Corsa. I just...ever since losing Zalbag, I've been so...everything's been just...off...
Corsa: I understand, Ramza... [pulls out yellow feather] I've also lost someone dear to me...
Ramza: You would liken losing my brother to losing your pet?
Corsa: not my pet, Ramza, my father. He was turned into a Chocobo by a mad alchemist's potion. He...also died, at Zekaden.
Ramza: I...Never thought...
Corsa: Ramza...
Ramza: That you'd take me for such a fool. Goodbye, Corsa. [runs off]
[Corsa stands there, heartbroken, watching him leave. Slim & Teta enter]
Slim: I tried to talk her out of it, but she insisted on coming.
Teta: Have...have you found Ramza yet, Corsa?
[Corsa runs off]

[End scene]

~Igros Castle

[knights & archers everywhere]
Ramza: Damn! I was sure...
Corsa: [offscreen] Ramza! [Enters] Head in. We'll take care of the troops outside.
Ramza: Corsa...thank you... [runs inside]

~Inside Igros Castle

Dycedarg: You've come alone, I see?
Ramza: To you, yes. My men and the Death Corps have this castle surrounded. I've come to finish you myself! (OOC: Had to correct this line because Dyce doesn't have enough troops to man the inside of his castle and Corsa needs all of Ramza's units to provide the distraction.)
Dycedarg: The Death Corps? I'm impressed, little brother - I didn't think you had it in you. I'd always taken you for the naivite of our Brother or Father.
Ramza: I'll not have you speak ill of them, Dycedarg!
Dycedarg: Manning up as well, I see. Good, it always bothered me when you called me Lord Brother anyways, let's go.

Ramza Turn 1
Ramza: I'm not naive, Dycedarg - nor were my brother or father.
Dycedarg: oh, of course not. You've always been on top of everything from the start. That's why you brought me that letter, instead of investigating it yourself.
Ramza: I trusted you!
Dycedarg: So did Father.

Dyecedarg at 50% HP
Dycedarg: You mean Sixe didn't tell you what happend to our Father? I thought you'd have pieced it together by now...
Ramza: What did you do to Father?
Dycedarg: You're familar with Mosfungus, yes? A nasty little poison - looks like little more than a cold, until it's too late. Of course, it only does this if administered in precise doses over a large amount of time...
Ramza: You bastard! Wait until Duke Larg hears of this!
Dycedarg: And who will he believe? A traitor to the throne...or his confidant?

Dycedarg OR Ramza at Critical HP
Dycedarg: I tire of this game. It's time you realigned your priorities.
[Dycedarg withdraws the Capricorn stone, producing a large flash of light]

~ Heaven?

Ramza: DYCEDARG!!! [looks around] Where...am I?
Altima (dressed as a modest servant of God): [teleports in] Follow me.
[Altima leads Ramza to Ajora]
Ramza: You're...
Ajora: yes, I am the Saint Ajora - sent once to bring judgment upon man.
Ramza: Is this all an illusion? Did I die? Where am I?
Zalbag: [teleports in] You would doubt your very eyes, Ramza? Of us three brothers, you were always the most trusting...what happened?
Ramza: Zalbag?
Delita: [teleports in] You've changed so much, Ramza. Teta's so sad right now - lonely and crying. We were like family, were we not? Would you have let Alma down?
Ramza: Delita, I...
Zalbag: Ramza - this is a chance to redeem yourself. A way to make it so my death is not in vain - to make it mean something. Maybe...this is why I died - to reassure you in this very moment!
Ajora: I have a journey for you, Ramza, a sacred task that only you can fulfill.
Ramza: [pause, glancing back and forth between Zalbaag and Delita] ...anything, Lord...
Ajora: Many years ago, I assembled heroes who wielded sacred power to march against injustice. Their souls are now immortalized in twelve Holy Stones. I call upon you, my son, to accept their spirit as the new Zodiac Brave.
Ramza: I...am I truly worthy of this honor?
Ajora: It is your birthright, as it was of the many saints who have come before you. A man named Vormav is collecting the Stones - uniting the Braves under my guidance. May peace follow in your footsteps...

[flash of light, scene changes]

Corsa: That was the last one. You and your sister are an excellent team, Malak.
Malak: We weren't the best in the Khamja for nothing. Right, Rafa?
Rafa: Always with your mission, brother. When will our battles finally be over?
Corsa: Soon, my friend. Let's charge! Ramza's counting on us!
Teta: So much blood. I'm...not sure I can...(Slim holds her.)
Slim: Don't be afraid, Teta. You have me. They can't touch you as long as I'm here! (OOC: Is this too sudden a transition for Slim? I don't really see him abandoning Corsa any time soon.)(@@@Soften this line)
[Ramza materializes before the castle gate and crumples over.]
Ramza: uurrrgggh.....
Corsa: Ramza! You...don't look well...Quickly, everyone! (rushes foward)
Ramza: Zalbag...(two generic units arrive)
Corsa: ...Fall back. Take him - he needs rest.

~ A small room

Old Man: Is he awake yet? We're already running low on supplies.
Corsa: No, but he mumbles a lot...as if talking with someone. I've heard Zalbag's name many times. (OOC: I had to change that because Corsa is somewhat skilled at healing herself. She wouldn't rely on a healer to do all the work.)
Ramza: [sitting up, with a start] NO! Eh...wait....where am I?
Corsa: A healer's house in Fovoham. You've been asleep 2 days, Ramza; I was getting worried.
Ramza: I...I need to go...
Corsa: No! You can barely stand right now!
Ramza: I saw him, Corsa...
Corsa: Zalbag?
Ramza: Ajora.
[pause]
Ramza: He gave me a sacred quest, and I must comply. Something that would bring meaning to Zalbag's death...something that would help keep Teta safe...
Corsa: You're talking nonsense, Ramza...
Ramza: You don't understand, Corsa...I'm one of the Braves. I need to find my stone, and reunite with the current leader.
Old Man: Child, did you see a vision? (Ramza nods)
Corsa (shakes her head): ...Ramza, if you want to leave us for a fool's errand, you need to be healthy first...

[end scene]

Mysterious Man 1 (Vormav): So, it is done?
Rofel: It has already been confirmed: everything is in place. (OOC: We don't want it being obvious to FFT newbs Ramza really went to Hell, at least, not yet.)
Myserious Man 2 (Draclau): We are fortunate, Vormav. Tales long past have been more than kind to us, and it only makes this easier.
Vormav: This is almost too easy - having it happen this way. With one more ally in order, we have only to continue our own quest.
Mysterious Man 2: Right - find it, and everything else will slowly come into place...
Vormav: Virgo...

[end chapter 2]
