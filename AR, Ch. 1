Mission 4: Slums of Dorter Trade City

Cloaked Man: You're kidding, right?
Death Corps 1: We've had enough of you, and a change of management is in order.
Cloaked Man: So you'd rather stain your hands in blood rather than dirt? What kind of men are you?
Death Corps 2: We want to go forward, not backwards! My father toiled his whole life to buy our family's freedom. What makes you think I'd willingly return to the land as your serf, to work at your bidding?
Cloaked Man: Can't you see I am fighting in the same cause as your father? If we succeed, no one will ever again need to buy the freedom that is his birthright! Progress is a world where nobles and merchants have nothing beneath them and the peasant has no one above him. It is not a world where everyone fights to be a noble; oppression will simply grow back under another name. 
Death Corps 3: You're just chasing phantoms! There's always gonna be stupid people; if we don't take advantage, someone else will! (Draws their weapons)
Cloaked Man: You're right; as long as cruel and heartless fools like you lot exist, there can be no peace! (Cloaked Man draws his sword as Ramza, Delita, and Algus enter.) In the name of all, I will bury you under my feet!
(Enter Ramza, Delita, and Algus)
Ramza: What's going on here? Why is that man being attacked?
Algus: Must be the spy, leave him to his fate.
Delita: If that's the case, perhaps we should save him, Ramza? Your brother would be pleased to have what information he has.
Ramza: Good point, Delita. Let's go, save this man from the Death Corps!
Cloaked Man's Turn:
Cloaked Man: Traitors on one side, the Hokuten on the other. The Bear and the Lion are at each other's necks!
Ramza: Don't worry, we'll help you!
Cloaked Man: is he talking to me, or them? (OOC: I don't like this line, but I'm not sure how to fix it. (Myrm) line's flavour rather than content - theoretically unsure as to who Ramza's attacking. I can change/remove it, no problem.)

Post Battle:
Ramza: Are you unharmed?
Cloaked Man: Essentially.
Algus: Better than you deserve. So are you going to hand over the information, or no?
Cloaked Man: I don't have time for these games.
Algus: Why you little...(Delita holds Algus back; Algus's line here and Delita's restraint come as an interruption, and shouldn't stop the flow of Sixe's text)
Cloaked Man: The biggest rat is still hiding in the Sandy Cellar. He goes by the name of Gustav and he alone kidnapped Elmdor. [Rides away] (OOC: Builds the suspense, leads into Sixe's plot, and shows that Sixe is the one commanding the tempo of the negotiations.)
Ramza: Wait! How do you know that? Wait! (Algus shakes Delita off)
Algus: I don't get it. Who's this Gustav?
Delita: Gustav Magueriff, a captain of the Death Corps.
Algus: Fine, let's say that this animal has the information Lord Zalbag wants - where are we going, anyways?
Ramza: 'Sand Rat Cellar'.
Algus: Sand ra-a-a-ts?
Delita: Algus may not know what they are since he's not from here. "Sand Rats" only inhabit the Zeklaus Desert north of Dorter.
Algus: Wha?
Ramza: Was there a village between Dorter and Zeklaus Desert?
Delita: Not anymore. But there is a place where desert people used to gather...
Ramza: ......Gustav and the Marquis may be there.
Delita: Yes, probably.
Algus: What are you all talking about?
Ramza: The desert people are known as "Sand Rats". The "Cellar" is their nest.
Algus: ...Of course...seems only appopriate for vermin like them... (OOC: I'm not sure how else to show Algus is embarrassed for being stupid. The vanilla dialogue needs a tweak because it always seemed fairly obscure to me when I read it through.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 5: Same

After Mission 5 (Broken Down Stone Shed):
Cloaked Man (no longer wearing his hat from before): Why have you betrayed us, Gustav?
Gustav: Surprised that I took a page out of your playbook, Sixe? You think you're the only one with a brain?
Sixe: What?
Gustav: I know about the Romandian silver. How else would a shit like you rise so fast? It's time for me to give you a taste of your own medicine!
Sixe: Is this your best excuse? I'm sorry, Gustav, not even an idiot like Prince Larg would accept that.
Sixe lowers his blade. Gustav sees the opening, and takes it. (Dies as in vanilla.)
Sixe: You had so much potential, but you never once learned from your mistakes. Goodbye, Gustav.
Enter Ramza and crew.
Algus: Marquis! (Gasps) You...you're Sixe!
Sixe: (OOC: Insert Witty comment here)
Elmdor: ugghhh....
Algus: If you touch one hair on his head, I'll kill you!
Sixe (sheathes his blade): Relax. The Marqius is unhurt. Take him back to Limberry.
Algus: What?! Don't trifle with me.
Sixe: I am not your enemy. I did not order this attack. This pathetic coward (points to Gustav) was merely following the orders of Prince Larg and Lord Dycedarg. Treasonous scum like him don't deserve to live.
Ramza: What? You mean to say...my brother ordered this...?
Sixe: So you're the youngest Belouve? (Sixe reaches into his shirt and produces two folded documents.) Your pride must be hurt, but I have proof.
Algus: You're nothing but trash! You think you can beat us? You probably just made the whole...
Delita: Enough, Algus! He's serious.
Ramza: Delita, you mean...you actually believe him? Surely, Lord Brother wouldn't...
Delita: Even if it is fake, I'd rather the letters in our hands. Think of the consequences if Prince Goltana were to get ahold of them!
Algus: Don...don't be paranoid, Delita. Ramza and I both know the Prince would never believe such a ridiculous conspiracy theory. (OOC: Algus is trying to hide his stupidity and desire. He just realized Delita's fear that Sixe would give the information to Goltana via Elmdor is actually a good idea that would benefit him. AS a result, he's trying to obstruct Delita without showing his hand. Feel free to improve on this.)
Ramza: Even if you're right, Algus, we cannot take any chances.
Algus: Grr...(his eyes meet Sixe's as he hands over the letters) Hold it, we're not done with you! (Sixe leaves the room; Algus tries to chase but is blocked by Delita) Damn you, Delita, why do you stop me?
Delita: Don't risk it. The Death Corps will destroy itself.

Intermezzo at Igros: If Ramza accepts Sixe's offer, Ramza and Delita then turn over the evidence to Dyce for confirmation, who promptly throws it in the fire.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 6: At Thieves' Fort, you fight Corsa [my Miluda replacement and Sixe's wife]. In the pre-battle scene, she enters the fort on a yellow chocobo and takes the role of optimistic leader [while the thieves around her are the ones with doubts].
Interaction:
Priestess: Why are you nobles even fighting us? We aren't your enemy.
Algus: Humph...ridiculous. You dogs need to know in your place!
Corsa: Maybe you should know yours. We starve ourselves to feed the likes of you. We exhaust our youth to forge your weapons and fight your wars. Have you no gratitude, or at least some shame? You are ruining people no different than yourselves!
Algus: Human? These dogs were never human! They were born to serve and die for us! It's the Will of Heaven! Why don't you see this, and stop rolling in their own filth with them?
Priestess: Heaven? God would never say such things! In his eyes, we are all equal.
Algus: Animals have no God!
Priestess: !!!!
Corsa: Enough, [insert generic name here]. We aren't all pigs like him.
Algus: !!!!
Delita: Algus, calm down. Don't prove her right.

Corsa: So many innocent lives...why did we have to fight today?
Ramza: I...I...
Algus: Don't lose your resolve, Ramza! Kill her now! She's your enemy and an enemy of your family! She wants to live like a mongrel, treat her like one. How can she even be a leader? Losers cannot remain alive! Besides, if we don't kill her, she'll kill us! We cannot coexist! Kill her, Ramza, with your own hands!!!
Delita: Ramza, I don't see why she is our enemy.
Algus: What did you say?! Are you mad, Delita?
Delita: She's not an animal...She's human just like us...
Algus: Are you betraying us?! You too?! Damnit, I'll kill her myself! (lunges forward)
Corsa smiles and whistles. A yellow chocobo charges straight at Algus, who sidesteps the bird. In one motion, Corsa mounts the bird and kicks Algus. She leaves the scene leaving Algus dumbstruck.

Intermezzo at Mandalia: Same

Background: Windmill Shed (inside)
Sixe: Golagros, Corsa, explain yourselves.
Golagros: Your stupid girlfriend lost the Weather Unit! I had to take a hostage to escape!
Corsa: So the ends justify the means?
Golagros: Fucking bitch! You only got away because my raid created a diversion. I covered your ass!
Corsa: Stop lying. When I arrived in Mandalia the first time that afternoon to complete my mission, the Hokuten chased me the entire way. Where were you then?
Golagros: Where I was assigned, Mandalia North. The Hokuten had a fuckton of volunteers and I was busy.
Corsa: And why did the Hokuten have so much support?
Golagros: Do I really have to answer this again? The moment the Knights come, all the fuckups and assholes will come out like bees to honey.
Corsa: Golagros, do you ever listen? They only exist because you are no better than the Hokuten. You can't just force people to obey us.
Golagros: Damnit Corsa, stop dodging the blame! Why the hell did you lose the Weather Unit?
Corsa: The enemies were no older than me. Except for one of them...something about them...I just couldn't kill them.
Golagros: So you risked your own life and had our men die?!
Corsa: Well, I didn't see a way to get away without killing them all.
Golagros: Are you fucking serious? (turns to Sixe) Sixe...I know she's your girl and all, but how the hell does she have the same rank as me? She has no killer instinct! She's just a little girl who can't even kill someone without crying.
Sixe: Enough! Both of you have harmed our efforts. Golagros, your raid gave the Hokuten the moral advantage; you just proved all of their worst lies true.
Golagros: Com'on, Sixe, don't you see?! She's not just any hostage; she's a Belouve! We can force 'em to do what we want noW!
Sixe: The Belouves will then attract the sympathy of everyone who has ever lost a child. Do you think we can fight them all?
Golagros: They already had that Elmdor bit... 
Sixe: We made fools of Gustav's followers because we stood by our principles, Golagros. That's why the peasants remained loyal. But now, with your actions, even they must have doubts. Starting tomorrow, I'm redeploying you. Anabelle will tell you more. (Golagros leaves; Corsa turns to leave.) Corsa, I'm not done. 
Corsa (turns around): Yes?
Sixe: You cannot keep doing this. We only have so many men. I'm assigning you to the militia until I can trust you in command.
Corsa: Sixe, will the Hokuten even attack us here? Lenalia hasn't faced a real threat in months.
Sixe: Don't let your hopes blind you, Corsa. With our other units already defeated, they must us attack here.
Corsa: ...what of the girl? We can't keep her here.
Sixe: We won't stay long in this base. When we leave, I'll return her.
Corsa: What?! (Corsa runs to leave.)
Sixe: Corsa, wait...(Sixe runs to leave)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 7:

Interaction:
Corsa: Just my luck. You are Delita, correct?
Delita: Where is Teta? Where are you hiding her?!
Corsa: I will lead you to your sister if we both lay down our arms. (She places her sword onto the ground.)
Death Corps Knight: Commander, are you insane?
Corsa: Trust me, [insert random name]. We won't need to fight.
Ramza:
Option A = I don't believe you.
Option B = I made a promise to Delita.

Delita: Ramza, are you crazy?! That's my sister you're abandoning!
Ramza: Delita, we can't trust her words!
Corsa: I promised Teta I would free her. All I ask is your trust.
Ramza: Then why did your allies kidnap her?
Corsa: I would never kidnap anyone! Golagros kidnapped her against Sixe's orders! I am only trying to fix his wrongs!
Ramza: You're our enemy. We have no reason to believe you.
Delita: Ramza...are you sure? (Ramza nods. Delita takes a step back and faces Corsa) I'm sorry, Teta...but orders are orders.
Corsa: You leave me no choice. (Corsa picks up her sword.) Prepare yourselves!

On Corsa's Turn:
Corsa: Why are you following these orders?
Ramza: It's our duty as knights to uphold justice.
Corsa: Is it just to cause needless death? We're only trying to defend our land!
Ramza: This land was never yours. It belongs to the lords you drove out!
Corsa: What right do the lords have to our land? They take our crops without ever sweating in the fields. If the harvest is bad, they'd rather feed their own mouths and let us starve! They're the real thieves!
Ramza: Aren't you being selfish? We are sworn to protect everyone.
Corsa: Protection? You nobles create the problems you then "protect" us from. It is your taxes that drives sons to brigandry and daughters to whoredom. It is your wars that devastate our villages, giving us no choice but your aid. Why should we trade our future for your protection if it can't even save our own families?
Delita: Teta...

On Corsa's 2nd Turn:
Ramza: Not all nobles are like that! My father always fought for what's right!
Corsa: Your father?
Ramza: Balbanes Belouve, leader of the Hokuten during the Fifty Years' War!
Corsa: Do you mean to tell me the Hokuten, under your father, committed no crimes at all, in all fifty years of war?
Ramza: I...well...even if a few men acted badly, my father never gave those orders.
Corsa: Explain that to my father! During his...service in the Hokuten, he was ordered from the very top to burn down entire villages right here in Lenalia. The victims were mostly boys no different than you; their only crime was dodging a tax that the plague and Romanda had already taken from them! If your father was truly a hero, Ramza, then where was his mercy? 
Ramza: Delita...did that really...
Delita looks away, and then gazes at the grass.

On Corsa's 3rd Turn:
Ramza: I...I'm sorry that had to happen. I didn't know!
Corsa: If you are truly sorry, then stop repeating the crimes of your father.
Ramza: I...I can't let down my family. As a Belouve...
Delita: RAmza! Think about what you are saying!
Ramza: Delita, don't you feel the same way?
Delita: I...yes...but not like this!
Death Corps Knight: Give it up, Commander. You already gave it your best.
Corsa looks over, surprised at the interruption.
Death Corps Knight: They're nobles. Hypocrisy is in their blood. There's nothing we can do about it except cut them down!
Corsa: For us to live, we must stain our clean hands in innocent blood. (Corsa shakes her head.) Father, you were right...but I won't die here!

Victory:
Corsa: Sixe...I'm sorry...
Delita: Damnit, who the hell am I?!!!

Inside of the Windmill Shed
Sixe: Golagros, are you ready?
Golagros: As ready as I'll ever be for one of Anabelle's crazy-ass plans. Do we really have to go this far, Sixe?
Sixe: WE need to restore the initiative or we will not even have the space for escape! Only the boldest plans can succeed.
Golagros: Yeah, but there's a line between bold and fucking retarded! We ain't gotta backup this time.
Sixe: What are you suggesting?
Golagros: I ain't dying for this, Sixe. If I go, I'm takin' the Belouve girl with me! She'll at least buy me some time if things go wrong.
Sixe: Golagros, I forbid it!
Golagros: We're desperate and you know it! Who the fuck cares if two wrongs don't make a right? Are you gonna die for that?
Slim (enters in a hurry): Sixe...they...they...(begins to cry)
Sixe: What is it, Slim? Did something happen?
Slim: They killed Corsa! They're on their way now...
Golagros gives Sixe a knowing look.
Sixe: What?! Corsa... (Sixe looks to the floor in dejection before looking back up with his fist raised.)
Sixe: Golagros, go now and leave the girl here! I'll defeat them myself! (Sixe rushes out the door Slim entered in.)
Slim: Hey wait! I loved her too, Sixe! Waait up! (Slim runs out the door.)
Golagros: Hey kid! You ain't even close to ready! Ah fuck it...let's go boys...(Golagros leaves out the other exit with his men.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mission 8

Sixe: I'd never thought such familiar faces were capable of such cold murder. The girl you killed was my wife!
Ramza: She was his wife?!
Sixe: In Corsa's name, prepare to die!

On Delita's Turn:
Delita: Give Teta back!
Sixe: She never was our slave to begin with. In fact, Corsa told me she isn't even a Belouve.
Ramza: It doesn't matter who she is to you; she's Delita's sister. Return her!
Sixe: She is inside our headquarters, but she'll only be released once we defeat your army in Zeakden. She was stolen from you, but we cannot return her from a position of weakness.
Ramza: Corsa wanted Teta to be free. You would keep Teta to dishonor her memory?
Slim: You fucking hypocrite! You're the one who killed her! Die, bastard!
Sixe: Slim, this is my fight! I demand that you leave!
Slim: I loved her too, Sixe. You know I'm saying what you feel!

On Ramza's First Turn:
Ramza: You two do not honor her memory by fighting me! All that will bring is Corsa's fate.
Sixe: Don't waste your breath on a girl you don't even know! Her death will only result in your doom!
Ramza: There are ways other than fighting. Can we talk?
Sixe: Will talk bring back my Corsa? Will talk bring back all the peasants who starved in the last war?
Ramza: With talking, we can stop things like that from happening again!
Sixe: Your brothers also talk, but it all is nonsense and blather. They scream like monkeys about our supposed cruelty all while whispering like demons about capturing the Crown. Why should I trust your words, Belouve?
Ramza: My brothers would do no such thing!
Sixe: You don't even trust your own eyes? Your family seal emblazoned the letter to Gustav for his "services" to the Hokuten. Only a gangster would call kidnapping a service!
Ramza: You...you made it all up! A Belouve would never do such a thing!
Slim: You're right. A Belouve would never do such a thing; that's why Dycedarg tossed the evidence into the fire!
Ramza: How...how.....

On Ramza's Second Turn:
Ramza: I...I...Even if all this is true, drop your sword, Sixe. If you make the effort to trust them, my brothers will return the trust.
Sixe: Don't lie to me with words you don't even believe! If you dropped your sword, you would be forced to flee, made a shameful traitor to your duty. It is no different for me!
Ramza: I'm not lying! As a Belouve, I fight for justice; if you are willing to be just, I can get them to listen!
Sixe: Your brothers won't listen to your justice when you yourself have never heeded its call! Before me, Corsa swore of your innocence to the point where even I was blinded by her false hope. Like a child, she pleaded to your decency, only to be repaid by your sword! You think I will repeat her error?!

Victory:
Sixe: Corsa...I'm sorry. I've failed you and everyone else. Now that I'm out of the way, Goltana and Larg will fight for the Crown over all of our graves.
Slim: Commander....
Sixe: Slim, leave me to die! You have a life to live!
Slim: I...
Sixe: Don't do it for me, Slim. Do it for...
Slim: Yes...I... (Slim rises and slips away.)

The following scene where they discover Teta missing is identical to vanilla except "Wiegraf" is replaced with "Sixe".

The Zeakden scene is identical except that the knight (revealed to be a Church spy in Reject / Reject) does not mention "Wiegraf" or "Sixe" when he leads Zalbag away.
